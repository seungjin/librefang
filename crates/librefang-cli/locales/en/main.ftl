# --- Daemon lifecycle ---
daemon-starting = Starting daemon...
daemon-stopped = LibreFang daemon stopped.
kernel-booted = Kernel booted ({ $provider }/{ $model })
models-available = { $count } models available
agents-loaded = { $count } agent(s) loaded
daemon-started-bg = Daemon started in background
daemon-still-starting = Daemon launched in background and is still starting
daemon-stopped-ok = Daemon stopped
daemon-stopped-forced = Daemon stopped (forced)
daemon-error = Daemon error: { $error }
daemon-already-running = Daemon already running at { $url }
daemon-already-running-fix = Use `librefang status` to check it, or stop it first
daemon-not-running-start = Daemon is not running. Start it with: librefang start
daemon-no-running-found = No running daemon found
daemon-no-running-found-fix = Is it running? Check with: librefang status
daemon-restarting = Restarting daemon...
daemon-no-running-starting = No running daemon found; starting a new daemon
daemon-bg-exited = Background daemon exited before becoming healthy ({ $status })
daemon-bg-exited-fix = Check startup logs: { $path }

daemon-start-fail = Could not start daemon: { $error }
daemon-start-fail-fix = Start it manually: librefang start
shutdown-request-fail = Shutdown request failed ({ $status })
could-not-reach-daemon = Could not reach daemon: { $error }
# Issue #4693 — after `curl install.sh | sh` upgrades the binary without
# restarting the running daemon, `librefang restart` (new CLI) hits the old
# daemon's `/api/shutdown` and is rejected with 401 because the new CLI's
# Authorization header does not match the old daemon's expected key (typical
# trigger: locked vault, rotated `[api] api_key`, or freshly enabled
# dashboard credentials). Surface the cause + auto-fall-back to PID-based
# shutdown so users can move forward without hand-editing config.
shutdown-401-detected = Shutdown request was rejected by the running daemon (401 Unauthorized).
shutdown-401-explainer = The new CLI cannot authenticate against the daemon that is currently running. This usually happens after `curl install.sh | sh` upgrades the binary without restarting the daemon — the running daemon was started with a different api_key, or the vault that holds it could not be unlocked.
shutdown-401-fallback-attempt = Falling back to a PID-based stop (PID { $pid })...
shutdown-401-fallback-success = Daemon stopped via PID { $pid }
shutdown-401-fallback-fail = PID-based stop did not work either.

    kill { $pid }    # or: kill -9 { $pid } if it does not exit
    librefang start
shutdown-401-no-pid-fix = Could not read the daemon PID from { $path }. Run `ps -ef | grep librefang` to find it, then `kill <pid>` and `librefang start`.
