//! Tool-result history fold — mechanism 3 of #3347.
//!
//! After `history_fold_after_turns` assistant turns have elapsed, tool-result
//! messages from those older turns are "stale" and contribute noise to the
//! context window without materially helping the agent.  This module folds
//! them into compact summaries so the LLM sees the history without the raw
//! payload bulk.
//!
//! # Algorithm (#4866 — batched-call + persistence)
//!
//! 1. Walk `messages` and count assistant turns.  Any tool-result user message
//!    that was answered before the most recent `history_fold_after_turns`
//!    assistant turns is marked stale.
//! 2. Collect every stale `ContentBlock::ToolResult` across those messages
//!    and ask the aux-LLM (or the primary driver when no aux chain is
//!    configured) for **one** batched call that returns a JSON array of
//!    per-`tool_use_id` summaries.
//! 3. Rewrite each stale `ContentBlock::ToolResult.content` in place using
//!    the matching per-id summary.  `tool_use_id` / `tool_name` / `is_error`
//!    / `status` are preserved, only `content` is replaced with
//!    `"[history-fold] <summary>"`.
//! 4. Return a `FoldResult.rewrites` map (`tool_use_id → "[history-fold] …"`)
//!    so the caller can replay the same rewrite onto the durable
//!    `session.messages` and call `session.mark_messages_mutated()` — without
//!    that step the fold runs from scratch every turn (axis 2 of #4866).
//! 5. Pinned messages are never folded (they are protected work product).
//!
//! Earlier drafts of this module (pre-#4866) made one aux-LLM call per
//! `group_consecutive` run of stale indices.  In practice
//! `collect_stale_indices` always returned indices interleaved with
//! assistant turns (e.g. `[2, 4, 6, …]`), so every group was size 1 and
//! the cost-amortiser knob (`min_batch_size`) gated the *pass* but not the
//! per-block calls — yielding `O(stale_count × turns)` aux-LLM round-trips.
//! The batched call collapses the pass to one round-trip; the persistence
//! step collapses the lifetime cost to `O(stale_count)` overall.
//!
//! # tool_use ↔ tool_result pairing — why we don't replace messages
//!
//! Earlier drafts replaced each stale tool-result message with a single
//! `Message::user(Text("[history-fold] ..."))` plain-text message.  That
//! broke conversation invariants: provider APIs (Anthropic Messages,
//! OpenAI Responses, Gemini function_call) require every assistant
//! `tool_use` block to be answered by a `tool_result` block carrying the
//! same `tool_use_id`.  Replacing the user message with free-form text
//! left the matching assistant `tool_use` orphaned, and the next provider
//! call returned `400 invalid_request_error: messages: tool_use ids must
//! match tool_result tool_use_ids`.
//!
//! Rewriting `ToolResult.content` in place keeps the `Blocks([ToolResult{
//! tool_use_id, ...}])` shape so every original `tool_use` still has its
//! matching `tool_result` — only the payload contracts.
//!
//! # Boundary choice
//!
//! Folding runs at the **pre-LLM-call boundary** (same as context compression)
//! so that the LLM always sees the compacted history regardless of whether the
//! session was loaded from disk mid-flight.  Running at session-load would also
//! work but would require async I/O at load time, complicating the sync path.
//!
//! # Fallback
//!
//! When the aux-LLM call fails (no key configured, network error, empty
//! response) the fold falls back to a static stub:
//! `[history-fold: summarisation unavailable]`.  When the call succeeds but
//! the response is not valid JSON the raw response text is applied to every
//! stale block instead (degrading to Option-1 bulk-summary semantics rather
//! than wasting the round-trip).  Either way the stale payload is removed
//! from context.
