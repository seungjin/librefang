//! Async task tracker registry (#4983).
//!
//! The kernel maintains a `HashMap<TaskId, PendingTask>` so async
//! operations spawned by an agent (workflow runs today, agent delegations
//! later) can deliver their terminal result back into the originating
//! agent session as a synthetic system message — without the agent having
//! to poll, and without bricking the conversation loop while the
//! operation runs. See `librefang_types::task` for the data shapes.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! - **Delete on delivery** — the registry entry is removed as soon as
//!   the `TaskCompletionEvent` is built and the injection attempt has
//!   completed. There is no retention window and no replay; the session
//!   history is the durable record.
//! - **Timeout ownership is agent-side** — the kernel does not impose a
//!   global default and does not garbage-collect on its own. The agent
//!   that registered the task is responsible for cancelling it; the
//!   `[async_tasks]` config block (`default_timeout_secs`,
//!   `notify_on_timeout`) configures the spawn-side behaviour.
//! - **Error shape is `TaskStatus::Failed(String)`** — conservative free
//!   form. A richer typed-error variant will land as an additive enum
//!   arm.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//!   register_async_task(agent, session, kind) -> TaskHandle
//!         |
//!         | (workflow / delegation runs in background)
//!         v
//!   complete_async_task(task_id, terminal_status)
//!         |
//!         | (looks up agent_id + session_id from the registry,
//!         |  builds TaskCompletionEvent, removes the entry,
//!         |  injects AgentLoopSignal::TaskCompleted into the
//!         |  per-(agent, session) channel via the existing #956 path)
//!         v
//!   Agent loop wakes up (or mid-turn injects) and surfaces the result.
//! ```
//!
//! `complete_async_task` is idempotent: calling it twice for the same
//! `TaskId` is a no-op on the second call (the entry was already
//! removed). This guards against retry races between the workflow engine
//! and any future supervisor that watches for terminal states.

    ///   re-registers against the same engine run — in which case sharing
    ///   the handle is the correct behaviour, not a bug.
    /// - **Delegation**: `prompt_hash` is opaque to the kernel (see the
    ///   docstring at `librefang_types::task::TaskKind::Delegation`) and
    ///   chosen by the caller. Two callers sending the same
    ///   `(target_agent, prompt_hash)` will share a single registry
    ///   handle and the completion event will be delivered to **only the
    ///   first caller's `(agent_id, session_id)`** (whichever attached
    ///   the registry entry). This is the documented contract: dedupe is
    ///   cross-session-idempotent across the `prompt_hash` namespace.
    ///   Callers that need per-session isolation must salt their
    ///   `prompt_hash` (e.g. include the calling session id in the hash
    ///   input) — the kernel does not silently distinguish them.
    ///
    /// Picking `kind`-only over `(kind, caller)` was deliberate: salting
