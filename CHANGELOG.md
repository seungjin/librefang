## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **BREAKING: delete dead `/api/channels/{name}/*` REST endpoints + their CLI / TUI surface** — per-channel-instance HTTP endpoints that all 404'd unconditionally after the in-process channel registry emptied: `GET /api/channels/{name}` (get_channel), `POST /api/channels/{name}/configure` (configure_channel), `DELETE /api/channels/{name}/configure` (remove_channel), `GET /api/channels/{name}/instances` (list_channel_instances), `POST same` (create_channel_instance), `PUT /api/channels/{name}/instances/{index}` (update_channel_instance_handler), `DELETE same` (delete_channel_instance), `POST /api/channels/{name}/test` (test_channel). Every handler started with `find_channel_meta(&name)?` which returned `None` since `CHANNEL_REGISTRY` is empty, producing a fall-through 404. The 9 handlers + 5 helper functions (`build_instance_fields_json`, `resolve_secret_env_overrides`, `canonical_json`, `instance_signature`, `read_disk_channels`, `PreparedWrite` / `prepare_fields_write` / `apply_secret_writes`, `send_channel_test_message`) + 2 type definitions (`ChannelMeta`, `ChannelField`) + 1 enum (`FieldType`) + 1 empty const (`CHANNEL_REGISTRY`) + 1 lookup (`find_channel_meta`) + 5 dispatchers (`is_channel_configured`, `webhook_route_suffix`, `webhook_endpoint_url`, `inject_callback_url`, `build_field_json`, `channel_config_values`, `channel_instance_count`, `channel_instances_serialized`) are gone. `list_channels` and `channels_snapshot` simplified to skip the empty-registry loop (they now serve sidecar rows exclusively via `sidecar_channel_rows` + `sidecar_discovery_rows`). The 9 supporting helpers in `routes/skills.rs` that powered the deleted handlers also go: `upsert_channel_config`, `remove_channel_config`, `build_channel_toml_table`, `append_channel_instance`, `update_channel_instance`, `remove_channel_instance`, `CHANNEL_AOT_CONFLICT_PREFIX`, `validate_env_var` (+ `DENIED_ENV_VARS` / `ENV_VALUE_MAX_LEN` constants), plus 16 unit tests covering them. The `test_channel_status_tests` + `instance_helper_tests` modules in `routes/channels.rs` are deleted entirely. **The CLI `librefang channel {list,setup,test,enable,disable}` subcommand group is also removed** — every wizard arm targeted an in-process adapter that had since migrated to a sidecar, and the wizard's fall-through arm already errored out for every supported channel; scripts that called these will now fail with `error: unrecognized subcommand 'channel'`. **The TUI `Channels` tab is also gone** — its `F8` / `Alt-8` shortcuts are retired and fall through to the default key handler rather than being silently swallowed; the screen module (`tui/screens/channels.rs`, 720 lines) + the `ChannelListLoaded` / `ChannelTestResult` events + the `spawn_fetch_channels` / `spawn_test_channel` helpers + the `handle_channel_action` dispatcher were all retired with it. **The dashboard SPA `ChannelsPage.tsx` (~1.5k lines) + its 524-line vitest file are deleted wholesale**, along with the `testChannel` / `configureChannel` / `listChannelInstances` / `createChannelInstance` / `updateChannelInstance` / `deleteChannelInstance` helpers in `api.ts`, the corresponding mutation/query hooks in `lib/mutations/channels.ts` + `lib/queries/channels.ts`, the `instances(name)` factory entry in `channelKeys`, the typed-http-client re-exports in `lib/http/client.ts`, the `ChannelField` / `ChannelInstance` / `ChannelInstancesResponse` / `QrStartResponse` / `QrStatusResponse` types, and the four `wechatQrStart` / `wechatQrStatus` / `whatsappQrStart` / `whatsappQrStatus` helpers (the matching daemon QR routes had already been removed when WhatsApp / WeChat migrated to sidecars). The `/channels` route + its `lazyWithReload` entry are stripped from `router.tsx`, the route-type union in `App.tsx`, the runtime-section nav entry (and now-unused `Network` lucide import), the `n: { to: "/channels" }` vim-style shortcut in `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`, the `channels` command-palette navigate-to entry (the registry-browse entry that opens `librefang.ai/channels` in a new tab stays — it points at the public catalog, not the deleted dashboard route), and both `nav.channels` + the entire 48-key `channels` namespace from `locales/en.json` and `locales/zh.json` (i18n-parity script reports parity at 3445 keys). Stale `ChannelsPage`-references in `ProvidersPage.tsx`, `ProvidersPage.test.tsx`, `UsersPage.test.tsx`, and `DrawerPanel.test.tsx` doc comments are rewritten to drop the dead cross-reference. Dashboard typecheck (`pnpm typecheck`) clean; `pnpm test` 659/659 outside two pre-existing failure clusters in `ProvidersPage.test.tsx` (introduced by #5260's `useCredentialPools` without a matching mock update) and `ModelsPage.test.tsx` (zustand `persist` middleware hitting an unmocked jsdom `storage` shim) — both predate this PR and are tracked separately. The 4 surviving HTTP endpoints — `GET /api/channels` (list), `POST /api/channels/reload`, `GET /api/channels/registry` (now also declared in the utoipa bundle so it appears in the generated OpenAPI spec / SDKs), `POST /api/channels/sidecar/{name}/configure` — cover the post-migration dashboard contract. **Operator action required**: any custom integration that hit the deleted endpoints needs to switch to `POST /api/channels/sidecar/{name}/configure` for channel configuration; channel deletion happens by removing the corresponding `[[sidecar_channels]]` entry from `config.toml` then `POST /api/channels/reload`. Anyone scripted against `librefang channel …` should move to editing `[[sidecar_channels]]` directly + the sidecar configure REST endpoint. Net: **-6446 / +233 lines** across 27 files (Rust side: `routes/channels.rs` -1684, `routes/skills.rs` -934, `cli/main.rs` -302, `cli/tui/screens/channels.rs` -720, `cli/tui/mod.rs` -84, `cli/tui/event.rs` -95, `cli/tui/screens/mod.rs` +3, `openapi.rs` -5; dashboard side: `pages/ChannelsPage.tsx` -1488, `pages/ChannelsPage.test.tsx` -524, `api.ts` -156, `lib/mutations/channels.ts` -95, `lib/queries/channels.ts` -22, `lib/queries/keys.ts` -6, `lib/http/client.ts` -8, `App.tsx` -3, `router.tsx` -8, `components/ui/CommandPalette.tsx` -1, `lib/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` -1, `locales/en.json` -51, `locales/zh.json` -51, and small comment fixups in 4 unrelated pages). Workspace `cargo check --workspace --lib` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean; `cargo test -p librefang-api --lib` 653/653 (was 679 — 26 tests removed alongside the deleted helpers); `cargo test -p librefang-cli --lib` clean. (@houko)

### Changed

- **chore(channels): remove dead in-process channel scaffolding** — every channel runs as a sidecar now (#5459 closed the migration with google_chat); the kernel-side scaffolding that gated in-process adapter dispatch has zero remaining consumers and is gone. Concretely: (1) **`for_each_channel_field!` macro** + its `#[macro_export]` + 3 invocation sites in `channel_sender.rs::resolve_channel_owner` / `messaging.rs::resolve_agent_home_channel` (rewritten to scan `cfg.sidecar_channels` directly) + the `for_each_channel_field_macro_uses_dictionary_order` test (witness pool empty), (2) `channel_bridge.rs::channel_overrides` body — the `find_channel_info!` macro never expanded; the function now returns `None` unconditionally (per-channel overrides only live on sidecar adapters via `agent_channel_overrides`), (3) `channel_bridge.rs::start_channel_bridge_with_config` — the `check_channel!` macro + `has_any` flag + 18 stale "X migrated to sidecar" comments collapsed; the function now early-returns when `cfg.sidecar_channels.is_empty()`, (4) `routes/channels.rs::instance_helper_tests` 4-test suite that broke at runtime after #5455 emptied `CHANNEL_REGISTRY` (their `find_channel_meta("webhook")` panicked because webhook had migrated; suite retired with the witness pool), (5) `OneOrMany<T>` type + JSON-schema + serde impls + my own `OoMTestRow` regression tests from `librefang-types/src/config/serde_helpers.rs` — no production caller left after every `OneOrMany<XConfig>` channel field went away, (6) `ChannelsConfig` body comment-wall (18 redundant "X migrated to sidecar" doc comments — the type now only carries the 3 `file_download_*` / `file_upload_max_bytes` global file-transfer fields, summarised in one doc paragraph), (7) Cargo feature aliases gone from 5 manifests: `librefang-channels::all-channels` / `librefang-api::core-channels` + `all-channels` + `all-channels-no-email` + `mini` / `librefang-cli::all-channels` + `mini` + `android` / `librefang-desktop::all-channels` + `mini` + `mobile-no-email`. `librefang-cli::default` drops `librefang-api/core-channels` (now just `["telemetry"]`); `librefang-api::default` drops `core-channels` (now just `["telemetry"]`). `.github/workflows/mobile-smoke.yml` drops the `-f mobile-no-email` flag from the Android tauri build (rustls-platform-verifier's Android workaround is no longer needed — the IMAP/SMTP code path it gated runs out-of-process). `librefang-channels/src/lib.rs` top-of-file docstring rewritten to drop the "40+ pluggable messaging integrations" claim + the 18-line `// X migrated to sidecar` migration comment wall. Net: **-628 lines** across 13 files. No behaviour change — every removed symbol was either an unused macro / dead code path or a feature alias that had collapsed to `[]`. Workspace `cargo check --workspace --lib --tests` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean; `cargo test -p librefang-types` 817/817, `-p librefang-api` 679/679 (4 previously-broken instance_helper_tests now properly retired), `-p librefang-kernel` 1079/1079. (@houko)

### Removed

- **BREAKING: removed 6 low-value channel adapters** — `viber`, `messenger`, `nostr`, `discourse`, `mqtt`, `linkedin`. Full cascade: `src/<name>.rs` deletions; `lib.rs` mods; `Cargo.toml` features in both `librefang-channels` and `librefang-api` (plus the `k256` / `rumqttc` optional deps that nostr / mqtt pulled in); the channels-allowlist entries (so `cargo xtask channel-policy` permanently blocks reintroduction); `<Name>Config` structs + `Default` impls; `channels.<name>` fields in `ChannelsConfig` + its `Default`; the validation-hook env-var checks; `channel_bridge.rs` imports, spawn blocks, `find_channel_info!` / `check_channel!` macro arms, and default-empty test assertions; `routes/channels.rs` `ChannelMeta` entries plus the 4 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser`); the `webhook_route_suffix` allowlist entries; `routes/config.rs` `ch!()` calls; kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` macro entries and expected-name list; CLI TUI `ChannelDef` entries; docs `[channels.X]` blocks in `configuration/page.mdx` / `configuration/channels/page.mdx` (en + zh) and the corresponding `integrations/channels/{social,integrations}/page.mdx` tutorial sections. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.viber]` / `[channels.messenger]` / `[channels.nostr]` / `[channels.discourse]` / `[channels.mqtt]` / `[channels.linkedin]` block is no longer recognised — remove it from `config.toml`. (@houko)
- **BREAKING: drop 12 unmaintained in-process channel adapters** — `gitter`, `keybase`, `flock`, `pumble`, `revolt`, `guilded`, `mumble`, `xmpp`, `irc`, `threema`, `twist`, `voice` are removed wholesale: adapter modules under `crates/librefang-channels/src/`, the matching `[channels.<name>]` config structs (`IrcConfig`, `XmppConfig`, `GitterConfig`, `KeybaseConfig`, `FlockConfig`, `PumbleConfig`, `RevoltConfig`, `GuildedConfig`, `MumbleConfig`, `ThreemaConfig`, `TwistConfig`, `VoiceConfig`), the per-channel `cargo` features (`channel-<name>`, incl. removal from `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email` / `mini`), the `channel_bridge` import/check/boot blocks, the kernel `for_each_channel_field!` macro entries, the API channel registry (`ChannelMeta` / `is_channel_configured` / `channel_config_values` / `channel_instance_count` / `channel_instances_serialized`), the CLI TUI `ChannelDef` rows, the `[channels.<x>]` configuration docs (en + zh), and the dashboard i18n `fld_irc` entry. The 12 basenames are removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so the sidecar-first ratchet (`cargo xtask channel-policy`) now permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce these adapters in-process. **Operator action required**: anyone setting `features = ["channel-<name>"]` (any of the 12) in `Cargo.toml` or carrying a `[channels.<name>]` block will fail to build / fail to deserialize on upgrade — pin a pre-removal release if you still need one of these in-process, or ship a sidecar adapter (see `docs/architecture/sidecar-channels.md` and the `librefang.sidecar` SDK examples under `sdk/python/`). The OpenClaw migrator (`librefang-migrate::openclaw`) now emits a warning instead of writing `[channels.irc]` when it encounters legacy IRC blocks. `voice` is removed because the standalone WebSocket STT/TTS channel was orthogonal to (and overlapped) the in-band audio transcription path that already lives in `librefang-runtime-media`; `xmpp` / `irc` users have migrated to Matrix and Discord respectively; the remaining nine adapters had effectively zero traction.

### Changed

- **Config samples now cover all 27 sidecar channel adapters.** `librefang.toml.example` and `crates/librefang-cli/templates/init_default_config.toml` previously sampled only 4 sidecars (telegram / discord / slack / wechat) — operators running `librefang init` or copy-pasting from the example file had no in-tree guidance for the other 23 (bluesky / dingtalk / email / feishu / google_chat / gotify / line / mastodon / matrix / mattermost / nextcloud / ntfy / qq / reddit / rocketchat / signal / teams / twitch / webex / webhook / wecom / whatsapp / zulip), even though they all shipped through the #5224 → #5459 migration project. Both files now carry a commented `[[sidecar_channels]]` block per adapter, generated from each adapter's own `SCHEMA` declaration via `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.<name> --describe` so the sample can never silently drift from the env-var contract the adapter enforces at startup. Each block lists the required env vars verbatim from the SCHEMA + up to 2 commonly-tuned optionals as inline hints; the full inventory is one `--describe` away. The 4 pre-existing blocks were rewritten into the same generated format. Sanitisations applied during generation so the sample stays operator-useful: secret-type values render as `"..."` (the SCHEMA `placeholder` for secret fields is free-text dashboard prose — `"from Settings → Development → Your apps"`, `"(production should always set this)"` — that doesn't belong in a TOML literal) BUT the original hint is preserved as a trailing `# <hint>` comment so semantic guidance like `TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN = "..."  # oauth:abc123… (the prefix is auto-added)` isn't lost; text placeholders with `"` get backslash-escaped; descriptions split on `". "` (period + space) so "Rocket.Chat REST API" doesn't truncate to "Rocket"; the redundant "(out-of-process sidecar)" suffix is stripped from per-block headers since the section header already documents this for all 27 entries. Per-block migration warnings (`# Migrated from in-process to sidecar in #<NNN>. Old [channels.<name>] blocks are no longer recognised.`) ship for all 27 adapters so an operator upgrading a pre-migration config gets an explicit signal at the matching block rather than a parser error in isolation. Two adapters whose SCHEMA marks every env-var optional but which still require operator input to start (whatsapp — Cloud API vs Baileys gateway; wechat — pre-supplied token vs QR-login) carry a one-line "Requires EITHER / OR" hint above the env table. ntfy carries a one-line privacy note that `NTFY_SERVER_URL` defaults to the public ntfy.sh server unless overridden. The generic "Sidecar channel adapters (out-of-process, any language)" section in `librefang.toml.example` that documents the protocol-level meta-fields (`restart`, `restart_initial_backoff_ms`, `message_buffer`, `overflow`, …) now sits ABOVE the 27 per-adapter blocks so the operator reads the protocol context first, then the specific instances. The generator script ships at `scripts/gen_sidecar_samples.py` for future re-runs when a new sidecar lands or a SCHEMA rotates — invoke as `cd sdk/python && python3 ../../scripts/gen_sidecar_samples.py > /tmp/blocks.txt`, paste between the marker headers in both files, then `cargo xtask schema-check gen` to refresh `xtask/baselines/config.sha256`. Also drops the stale `[channels.whatsapp]` in-process snippet (`phone_number_id_env` / `access_token_env` fields no longer exist post-#5445). Verification: `tomllib.load()` on both files clean; `cargo xtask schema-check gen && check` baseline regenerated and matches. (@houko)
- **BREAKING: Google Chat migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::google_chat` adapter (`GoogleChatAdapter`, 818 lines: service-account JWT auth via RS256 (rsa + sha2 crates), `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` exchange with 5-minute refresh buffer + double-checked-locking token cache, `https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/{space}/messages` outbound (text only, 4096-char chunking), axum-mounted `/channels/google_chat/webhook` route on the shared API server, `MESSAGE`-only inbound filter, `space.name` allowlist via `GoogleChatConfig.space_ids`, `space.type != "DM"` group detection, `text.starts_with('/')` → `ChannelContent::Command` routing, multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection, `ALLOWED_TOKEN_URI_PREFIXES` SSRF allowlist on the `token_uri` field of the service-account JSON) is deleted along with the `[channels.google_chat]` config schema (`GoogleChatConfig` + `Default` impl), the `channel-google-chat` cargo feature in both `librefang-channels` and `librefang-api` (which collapses `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email` / `mini` / `core-channels` to empty arrays — `webhook` migrated in #5455 was the only remaining sibling), the `rsa` optional dep in `librefang-channels/Cargo.toml` (no other in-process consumer left), the dashboard `ChannelMeta` descriptor + 4 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser`) + the `webhook_route_suffix` `google_chat` entry, the kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` entry + `EXPECTED` name-list (now both empty — no in-process channels left), the config-validation env-var hook (`service_account_env` + `service_account_key_path` presence check), the `channel_bridge` `GoogleChatAdapter` import + builder block + `check_channel!` invocation + `find_channel_info!` match arm, and the route-handler 412/200 test witness pair (`missing_required_env_returns_412` + `credentials_present_no_target_returns_200`) — retired because the in-process witness pool of channels with a `required: true` secret env var is now empty (rotation history: matrix → whatsapp → google_chat). The `routes/channels.rs::instance_helper_tests` 4-test suite is also retired (witness pool empty — `webhook` is also a sidecar after #5455). `google_chat` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process Google Chat adapter. `librefang-migrate`'s OpenClaw importer (both the typed `migrate_channels_from_openclaw` path and the loose-JSON `migrate_channels_from_json` path) records the legacy `[channels.google_chat]` block as a SkippedItem (same shape as Matrix / Feishu / Teams / WhatsApp / Webhook removals); the four channel-table helpers (`map_dm_policy`, `map_group_policy`, `build_channel_table`, `allow_from_to_toml_array`) that the in-process import paths used are all deleted with the Google Chat code path that was their last consumer. The CLI `librefang init <channel>` wizard match collapses to a fall-through unknown-channel hint (`maybe_write_channel_config` / `notify_daemon_restart` also removed). Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.google_chat` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/google_chat.py`, stdlib-only — `urllib.request` for REST + `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` over `HTTPServer` for inbound, no third-party deps): same service-account JWT auth path with an in-module PKCS#8 PEM parser + RSA modular-exponentiation signer + PKCS#1 v1.5 SHA-256 padding (`_parse_pkcs8_rsa_private_key`, `_pkcs1_sign_sha256`, `_sign_rs256_jwt` — covered by `test_jwt_signing_round_trip_against_test_pem`), same `ALLOWED_TOKEN_URI_PREFIXES` SSRF allowlist on `token_uri`, same `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` exchange with 5-minute refresh buffer cached in a `_TokenCache` (`threading.Lock`-backed, mirrors the Rust `Arc<RwLock<...>>`), same pre-supplied `access_token` fallback path (cached as `DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIFETIME_SECS`, no auto-refresh), same `https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/{space}/messages` outbound with 4096-char UTF-8-safe chunking, same `MESSAGE`-only / space-allowlist / DM-vs-group / `/cmd`-routing inbound semantics, same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection (#5003). The in-process adapter mounted onto LibreFang's shared axum server at `/channels/google_chat/webhook`; the sidecar runs its own webhook server (configurable `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_PORT`, default `8090`) so the public URL operators register in the Google Cloud Console Bot configuration changes from `https://<host>/channels/google_chat/webhook` to `https://<host>:<GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_PORT>/webhook`. **Three improvements over the Rust adapter**: (1) **401 clears the cached token** — the Rust adapter cached the OAuth2 access token until its TTL expired and surfaced a generic `Google Chat API error 401` on stale-token failures, forcing the operator to wait out the cache. The sidecar's `_send_text` clears `_token_cache` on 401 so the next send re-runs the JWT auth path; (2) **`WEBHOOK_MAX_BODY_BYTES = 1 MiB` cap on the inbound webhook body** — Rust inherited axum's default `DefaultBodyLimit` (2 MiB); the sidecar's `HTTPServer` enforces 1 MiB at the handler before allocating the body buffer, rejecting a malicious `Content-Length: 10G` with 413 before any read; (3) **start-time PEM validation** — the Rust adapter deferred RSA private-key parsing until the first `_get_access_token` call (lazy), so an invalid PEM surfaced as a runtime error on the first outbound. The sidecar parses + caches the `(n, d)` tuple in `__init__`, raising `RuntimeError` at boot so misconfigured deployments fail-fast. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.google_chat]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.google_chat` with `GOOGLE_CHAT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (the **full JSON blob**, not a path — in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`), `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_PORT` (default `8090`, in `[sidecar_channels.env]`). Optional knobs: `GOOGLE_CHAT_SPACE_IDS` (CSV, e.g. `spaces/AAAA,spaces/BBBB`; empty = all spaces), `GOOGLE_CHAT_ACCOUNT_ID` (multi-bot routing — surfaces as `google_chat:<id>` in `channel_defaults`), `GOOGLE_CHAT_API_BASE` (testing override). The Google Cloud Console Bot configuration messaging endpoint must be repointed to the sidecar URL. `ChannelType::Custom("google_chat")` is preserved via `channel_type = "google_chat"` on the sidecar entry so existing routing / `channel_role_mapping` keys that reference `google_chat` continue to resolve. After this PR there are **zero in-process channels** in the workspace — every channel runs as a sidecar. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_google_chat_adapter.py` — **32 passed** (env enforcement (missing JSON / bad JSON / no auth path), pre-supplied access_token construction, JWT construction parses PEM into `(n, d)` tuple, CSV space-id parsing, account_id propagation, bad webhook port raises, JWT `token_uri` SSRF allowlist (rejects `attacker.example`), inbound parsing (plain text / slash command / DM `is_group=false` / threaded / non-MESSAGE / empty text / space allowlist filter / empty filter = all), UTF-8-safe `_split_message` (short / empty / byte-boundary / multibyte), outbound `_send_text` (endpoint / auth header / chunking / 401 clears cache), `on_send` dispatch (real `Send` dataclass: `channel_id` happy-path / `cmd.user.platform_id` fallback / empty channel drops / non-`spaces/` channel drops / empty text drops), JWT round-trip against a 2048-bit test key (header / claims / signature byte length), schema sanity (required `secret`-type service-account field, `advanced=true` on account_id)). (@houko)
- **BREAKING: Webhook migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::webhook` adapter (`WebhookAdapter`, 772 lines: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification on `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>` with constant-time compare, optional `X-Webhook-Timestamp` replay-window check (±5 minutes), JSON inbound parsing for `{sender_id, sender_name, message, thread_id, is_group, metadata}`, slash-command routing on messages starting with `/`, outbound `POST {callback_url}` signed the same way with 65535-char chunking + 100ms inter-chunk delay, **SSRF guard** via `http_client::validate_url_for_fetch` (rejects private/loopback/link-local/multicast/cloud-metadata callback URLs at adapter construction), `deliver_only` mode that tags inbound with `__deliver_only__` + `__deliver_target__` metadata for the kernel's `bridge.rs:2845-2851` LLM-short-circuit routing) is deleted along with the `[channels.webhook]` config schema (`WebhookConfig`), the `channel-webhook` cargo feature in both `librefang-channels` and `librefang-api` (incl. its membership in `core-channels` / `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email` / `mini` — `core-channels` collapses to `channel-google-chat` alone now), the dashboard `ChannelMeta` descriptor + 4 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser`) + the `"webhook"` arm of `webhook_route_suffix`, the kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` entry + `EXPECTED` name-list, the config-validation hook (env-var presence + `deliver_only` needs `deliver`), the `channel_bridge` `WebhookAdapter` import + builder block + `check_channel!` invocation + `find_channel_info!` match arm, the route-handler 412/200 test witness (rotated `webhook` → `google_chat`), and the demo-only Python adapter that previously lived at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/webhook.py` (132 lines using a hand-rolled JSON-RPC protocol — replaced by the standard `SidecarAdapter`-framework port). `webhook` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process webhook adapter. The `librefang-types` `mod.rs` test rotations move the OneOrMany + `deny_unknown_fields` (#5130) witnesses from WebhookConfig to GoogleChatConfig (the LAST remaining in-process channel) and McpServerConfigEntry respectively; the `librefang-api` `config_routes_integration` boot-fail test rotates `[channels.webhook] listen_port = "eighty-eighty"` → `[channels.google_chat] webhook_port = "eighty-eighty"` for the wrong-type-coerce probe. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.webhook` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/webhook.py`, stdlib-only — `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` over `ThreadingTCPServer` for inbound, `urllib.request` for outbound, no third-party deps): same HMAC-SHA256 verification with constant-time compare, same ±5-minute timestamp skew window for replay protection, same sig-only fallback (with a per-request WARN log) when the timestamp header is absent — backwards-compatible with clients that never sent it; PRESENT-but-malformed timestamp returns 400 to distinguish "client bug" from "attacker probing the bypass" (matches webhook.rs:295-310). Auth failures collapse to a single `Forbidden` response so an attacker can't probe which check failed. Same JSON inbound parse (`message` / `sender_id` / `sender_name` / `thread_id` / `is_group` / `metadata`, fallbacks `"webhook-user"` / `"Webhook User"` for missing identity fields, empty `message` drops with 200 OK so caller doesn't retry). Same slash-command routing (`/cmd args` → `Command`). Same outbound shape (`{sender_id: "librefang", sender_name: "LibreFang", recipient_id, recipient_name, message, timestamp}`), 65535-char chunking, 100 ms inter-chunk delay. Same SSRF guard — pure-Python port of `http_client::validate_url_for_fetch` covering IPv4 (`0/8`, `10/8`, `127/8`, `100.64/10`, `169.254/16`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `192.0.0/24`, multicast `224-239`, reserved `240-255`), IPv6 (loopback, link-local, site-local, multicast, unique-local, IPv4-mapped via `::ffff:` and NAT64 via `64:ff9b::`), and reserved hostnames (`localhost`, `localhost.`, `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`). Same `deliver_only` metadata propagation (`__deliver_only__` + `__deliver_target__`) — kernel bridge routing is unchanged. Same multi-bot `account_id` injection (#5003). **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.webhook]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.webhook` with `WEBHOOK_LISTEN_PORT` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`). Optional knobs (all on the `[sidecar_channels.env]` block): `WEBHOOK_LISTEN_PATH` (default `/webhook`), `WEBHOOK_CALLBACK_URL` (optional outbound delivery, SSRF-guarded at startup AND on every send), `WEBHOOK_DELIVER_ONLY = "1"` + `WEBHOOK_DELIVER = "telegram"` for pass-through, `WEBHOOK_ACCOUNT_ID`. **Four improvements over the Rust adapter**: (1) **inbound dedupe on `platform_message_id`** — Rust assigned a fresh `wh-<timestamp_ms>` ID on each emit and never deduped, so a misbehaving upstream that delivered twice would double-emit. Sidecar threads either the inbound's own `metadata.message_id` (when present) or a synthesised `wh-<ms>-<body_hash[:8]>` ID through a bounded `SeenSet` (10000 cap / 5000 evict); the 8-char body-hash suffix prevents collisions between simultaneous deliveries at the same millisecond, which the Rust millisecond-only ID flattened together; (2) **429 `Retry-After` honoured** on outbound POSTs — Rust raised on first non-2xx (webhook.rs:476-480). Sidecar parses `Retry-After` (default 30 s, floor 1 s, cap 60 s), sleeps, retries, then logs-and-continues on the second 429 so a single throttled chunk doesn't drop the rest of a multi-chunk reply; (3) **explicit 30 s timeout** on every outbound POST — Rust relied on `reqwest`'s default; (4) **per-send SSRF re-check** — the Rust adapter validated the `callback_url` once at adapter construction; the sidecar re-checks before every POST so a config-reload that swapped the URL to a private host doesn't leak the signing secret to localhost. The `deliver_only` validation is also tighter: Rust warn-and-continued when `deliver_only=true` but `deliver` was unset (silent inbound drop at runtime); the sidecar fail-closes at startup with `SystemExit(2)`. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_webhook_adapter.py` — **74 passed** (env handling incl. all SSRF-rejection paths (loopback IPv4 / RFC 1918 / link-local / CGN / multicast / IPv6 loopback + link-local + IPv4-mapped / reserved hostnames / non-http scheme), signature verify (valid / wrong key / wrong body / missing / empty / wrong prefix / short-length-mismatch), `parse_webhook_body` happy path + missing-message drop + default-sender fallback + non-string-field defaults + non-dict, `_verify_request` (valid sig with/without timestamp / missing sig 403 / empty sig 403 / malformed-timestamp 400 / stale-timestamp 403 / future-timestamp 403 / wrong-sig 403 / ±300 s skew boundary), `_handle_webhook_body` end-to-end (happy / slash-command with-and-without args / msg-ID dedupe / account_id injection / deliver_only metadata / is_group propagation / invalid sig 403 / malformed JSON 400 / empty message 200 / 10-minute-old replay 403), outbound (basic / chunking / no-callback log+drop / signature round-trip verifies / 429 retry / non-2xx raises / empty text drops), `on_send` dispatch (text / user.platform_id fallback / empty recipient drops / unsupported placeholder), schema + capabilities).

The `librefang-migrate` `openfang.rs` drift tests rotate `[channels.whatsapp]` → `[[mcp_servers]]` (the remaining `deny_unknown_fields` witness after WhatsAppConfig went away) and the `config_routes_integration` boot-fail test rotates to `[channels.webhook]` for the wrong-type-coerce probe. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.whatsapp` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/whatsapp.py`, stdlib-only — `urllib.request` for REST + `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` over `ThreadingTCPServer` for inbound, no third-party deps): same Cloud API outbound for text / audio (URL link) / image (link + caption) / document (link + filename) / location, same gateway outbound proxy with graceful-degradation per-content-type to text in Web mode (voice URL → `(Voice message: <url>)`, image without caption → `(Image — not supported in Web mode)`, file → `(File: <name> — not supported in Web mode)`), same 4096-char chunking, same DM × group policy filter logic with TOML-string-compatible policy names (`respond` / `allowed_only` / `ignore` × `all` / `mention_only` / `commands_only` / `ignore`), same bot-mention detection (phone with / without `@` + `+` strip, name substring, all case-insensitive), same allowlist semantics, same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection (#5003). The shared `/channels/whatsapp/qr/*` routes are gone — the Baileys gateway (when still in use for Web/QR mode) is now operated as a separate `[[sidecar_channels]]` entry (or external service) and the kernel no longer embeds / auto-spawns the Node.js process. **Four improvements over the Rust adapter**: (1) **real Cloud API inbound webhook** — `WhatsAppAdapter::start()` at whatsapp.rs:454-483 was a `TODO` stub that logged "webhook ready" and never actually parsed incoming activities; operators wanting Cloud API inbound had to wire their own webhook → `/api/agents/{id}/message` forwarder. The sidecar implements the real handler: `GET {path}` returns `hub.challenge` for Meta's subscription confirmation when `hub.mode == "subscribe"` and `hub.verify_token` matches `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`; `POST {path}` verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` against `HMAC-SHA256(WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET, raw_body)` (constant-time compare), then parses `entry[].changes[].value.messages[]` and emits text events through the standard sidecar protocol; (2) **inbound dedupe on `message.id`** — Meta retries on non-200, bounded `SeenSet` (10000 / evict 5000) keeps redeliveries from double-emitting; (3) **429 `Retry-After` honoured** on every outbound POST — Rust warned-and-failed on the first non-2xx (whatsapp.rs:373-377); (4) **explicit 30 s timeouts** on every REST call — Rust relied on `reqwest`'s defaults. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.whatsapp]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.whatsapp`. For **Cloud API mode**: `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) + `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` / `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`), optional `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_PORT` (default `8460`) / `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_PATH` (default `/webhook`). For **Web/QR mode**: `WHATSAPP_GATEWAY_URL = "http://localhost:3009"` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and the Baileys gateway (`npx @librefang/whatsapp-gateway`) must be run separately — the kernel no longer auto-spawns it. Optional knobs in both modes: `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` (csv), `WHATSAPP_ACCOUNT_ID`, `WHATSAPP_BOT_PHONE` / `WHATSAPP_BOT_NAME` (for `mention_only` group policy), `WHATSAPP_DM_POLICY` / `WHATSAPP_GROUP_POLICY`. `ChannelType::WhatsApp` is preserved via `channel_type = "whatsapp"` on the sidecar entry so existing routing / `channel_role_mapping` keys continue to resolve.

The in-process adapter mounted onto LibreFang's shared axum server at `/channels/teams/webhook`; the sidecar runs its own webhook server (configurable `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_PORT` / `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_PATH`, defaults `8459` / `/webhook`) so the public URL operators register in the Azure Bot Channel configuration changes from `https://<host>/channels/teams/webhook` to `https://<host>:<TEAMS_WEBHOOK_PORT><TEAMS_WEBHOOK_PATH>`. **Four improvements over the Rust adapter**: (1) **per-conversation `service_url` reuse** — the Rust adapter stored the inbound `serviceUrl` in `metadata.serviceUrl` but never used it on outbound, so for tenant- / region-routed deployments where Microsoft assigns different service URLs per conversation, every reply silently landed on `DEFAULT_SERVICE_URL`.

Operators on Webhook mode must re-create the robot in the DingTalk Open Platform with stream subscription enabled and migrate to the sidecar's stream credentials (`DINGTALK_APP_KEY` + `DINGTALK_APP_SECRET` instead of `DINGTALK_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `DINGTALK_SECRET`). **Four improvements over the Rust adapter**: (1) **inbound dedupe on `messageId`** — Rust emitted every CALLBACK unconditionally; on reconnect + platform redelivery the bot could re-emit. Sidecar threads `messageId` through `librefang.sidecar.common.SeenSet` (capacity 10000, evict 5000); (2) **heartbeat-and-send coexist on one socket via stdlib `queue.Queue`** — Rust used `tokio::mpsc` with a separate read/write split; sidecar drains a queue between `wait_readable` ticks. `on_send` is non-blocking; the WS thread drains the queue between heartbeat ticks and message reads, so a slow `sessionWebhook` POST never wedges inbound; (3) **429 `Retry-After` honoured on every outbound POST** — Rust had no 429 handling, so a throttled `sessionWebhook` reply burned the chunking delay or dropped the chunk. Sidecar parses `Retry-After` (default 30 s, floor 1 s, cap 60 s), sleeps, retries once, then logs-and-continues on the second 429 (same shape as #5303 across other sidecars); (4) **explicit 15 s `urlopen` timeout on every HTTP call** — Rust used `reqwest`'s `.timeout(Duration::from_secs(15))` only on gateway registration; the outbound `self.client.post` relied on the client default. Sidecar passes `timeout=15.0` on every call so a misbehaving `sessionWebhook` host can't hang the send loop. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.dingtalk]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.dingtalk` with `DINGTALK_APP_KEY` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and `DINGTALK_APP_SECRET` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`); optional knobs are `DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS` (CSV staffId allowlist), `DINGTALK_ACCOUNT_ID`.

Sidecar threads the IDs through a bounded `SeenSet` (10000 capacity / 5000 evict); (2) **429 `Retry-After` honoured on every REST path** — Rust had no 429 handling at all, so a throttled `getupdates` or `sendmessage` either burned the backoff budget or dropped the chunk. Sidecar parses `Retry-After` (default 30 s, floor 1 s, capped at `WECHAT_MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`), sleeps, retries once, then logs-and-continues on the second 429; (3) **explicit 30 s timeouts on every REST call** — Rust pre-configured `reqwest`'s 90 s default; the sidecar tightens it so a wedged iLink endpoint doesn't pin the worker thread; (4) **shutdown event interrupts backoff** — `threading.Event.wait(backoff)` lets a `Shutdown` command exit the executor thread promptly. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.wechat]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.wechat`; persisted bot tokens move from a `WECHAT_BOT_TOKEN` env-var (still the same name, just consumed by the sidecar process now) into `~/.librefang/secrets.env`. Optional knobs: `WECHAT_ALLOWED_USERS` (csv), `WECHAT_ACCOUNT_ID`, `WECHAT_INITIAL_BACKOFF_SECS`, `WECHAT_MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`. The two dashboard endpoints (`/channels/wechat/qr/start` + `/qr/status`) are removed; the sidecar now logs the QR code itself at INFO. `ChannelType::WeChat` is preserved via `channel_type = "wechat"` on the sidecar entry so existing routing / `channel_role_mapping` keys continue to resolve.

Behaviour is preserved for **WebSocket mode** by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.wecom` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/wecom.py`, stdlib-only — RFC 6455 WS client via the shared `librefang.sidecar.ws.WebSocketClient`, no third-party deps): same `wss://openws.work.weixin.qq.com` endpoint, same `aibot_subscribe` handshake carrying `bot_id` + `secret`, same `cmd`/`action` and `body`/`data` legacy-key tolerance, same `userid`/`user_id` and `chattype`/`chat_type` fallback chain, same `is_subscribe_success` detection (both explicit `cmd: "aibot_subscribe"` ack AND server-style ack with `errcode: 0` + `headers.req_id` starting with `"aibot_subscribe"`), same `aibot_msg_callback` parsing with text-only msgtype filter (non-text msgtypes still silently dropped, mirroring `wecom.rs:103-106`), same per-user `req_id` cache so the first outbound after an inbound uses `aibot_respond_msg` (one-shot, evicted on send) and subsequent outbounds fall back to `aibot_send_msg`, same `msgtype: "markdown"` body shape (WeCom's intelligent-bot `aibot_respond_msg` rejects `msgtype: "text"`), same 4096-char chunking via the shared `split_message`, same 30 s `cmd: "ping"` heartbeat, same 1 → 30 s exponential reconnect backoff, same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection (#5003). **Callback mode is NOT ported** — Python's standard library has no AES-CBC primitive, and the sidecar SDK is stdlib-only by policy across all 19 reference adapters. Operators who relied on callback mode must either switch the bot to WebSocket mode in the WeCom admin console (it requires no public endpoint, so the WS path is a strict superset of what callback could do in restricted-egress environments), or ship their own callback-mode sidecar that brings its own AES dependency. **Three improvements over the Rust adapter**: (1) **inbound dedupe on `req_id`** — the Rust emit at `wecom.rs:770` was unconditional, so a WS reconnect that races with the platform's redelivery would emit the same message twice. The sidecar threads `req_id` through `librefang.sidecar.common.SeenSet` (capacity 10000, evict 5000), matching the dedupe envelope every recent sidecar (qq, mattermost, signal, line, matrix) settled on; (2) **heartbeat-and-send coexist on one socket via a stdlib `queue.Queue`** — the Rust adapter used a bounded `tokio::mpsc` (`wecom.rs:580`); the sidecar uses an unbounded `queue.Queue` polled at the same read tick as inbound. `on_send` is non-blocking; the WS thread drains the queue between heartbeat ticks and message reads, so a slow `aibot_send_msg` server-side never wedges inbound; (3) **send result is observable in logs** — the Rust adapter only logged `frame sent over WebSocket successfully` (`wecom.rs:631`) before the server ACK arrived; the sidecar logs the same plus the server's `errcode` / `errmsg` (when non-zero) on the ACK frame, so operators can correlate a `send succeeded` log line with the actual platform-side outcome instead of having to enable DEBUG. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.wecom]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.wecom` with `WECOM_BOT_ID` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and `WECOM_BOT_SECRET` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`); optional knobs are `WECOM_ALLOWED_USERS`, `WECOM_ACCOUNT_ID`.

Bounded `SeenSet` with `SEEN_MESSAGES_MAX=10000` / `EVICT=5000`; (2) **429 `Retry-After` honoured at every PUT, not just edit** — Rust's `api_edit_event_with_retry` honoured Retry-After but `api_send_event` and `api_redact` did not.

Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.qq` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/qq.py`, stdlib-only — `urllib.request` for REST, hand-rolled RFC 6455 WS client over `socket`+`ssl` like the discord/slack/webex/mattermost sidecars, no third-party deps): same token mint via `POST bots.qq.com/app/getAppAccessToken`, same `GET /gateway` discovery, same HELLO/IDENTIFY/READY/HEARTBEAT/DISPATCH/RECONNECT/INVALID_SESSION opcode handling, same intents bitmask default (`GUILDS | GUILD_MEMBERS | DIRECT_MESSAGE | GROUP_AND_C2C | PUBLIC_GUILD_MESSAGES`), same 4 dispatch event types with the same reply-endpoint mapping, same leading-`/` bot-mention strip, same allowlist + slash-command routing, same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection (#5003), same outbound markdown stripping pipeline (think tags, code blocks, inline code, bold, italic, headings, table separators, links, blockquotes, horizontal rules, three-or-more newlines), same 2000-char chunking, same 1–60s exponential reconnect backoff. **Four improvements over the Rust adapter**: (1) **reply context actually round-trips** — the Rust `parse_dispatch_event` (`qq.rs:182-246`) computed `reply_endpoint` and `msg_id` but the dispatch loop bound them to `_endpoint` / `_msg_id` (`qq.rs:399`) and dropped them on the floor; `send` (`qq.rs:497-498`) then expected `user.platform_id` to be encoded as `"<endpoint>|<msg_id>"` and silently no-op'd when the delimiter wasn't there. The Rust adapter therefore failed every real outbound — only the synthetic wiremock tests at `qq.rs:686-712` exercised the working shape. The sidecar surfaces the reply endpoint as `channel_id` and the QQ `msg_id` as `thread_id` on the inbound event so the bridge round-trips them through to `on_send`, which posts to `{api_base}{channel_id}` with the correct passive-reply `msg_id`; (2) **inbound dedupe on `msg.id`** — the Rust dispatch loop (`qq.rs:399-410`) emitted every parsed event unconditionally; a WS reconnect that races with the server's last-delivery cursor would re-deliver. Bounded local set on `id` with `SEEN_MESSAGES_MAX=10000` / `EVICT=5000` (same policy as reddit / rocketchat / nextcloud / webex / line / mattermost / signal); (3) **429 `Retry-After` honoured on every REST path** — Rust had no 429 handling, so a throttled `getAppAccessToken` / `/gateway` / outbound `POST` either burned the reconnect budget or dropped the chunk. Sidecar parses `Retry-After` (default 30 s fallback, floor 1 s, cap `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`), sleeps, retries once, then logs-and-continues on the second 429 (same shape as #5303); (4) **explicit 15s `urlopen` timeouts on every REST call** — `urllib.request.urlopen` has no default timeout; Rust pre-configured `reqwest`'s 30s default. Sidecar passes `timeout=SEND_TIMEOUT_SECS` (15 s) on every call so a misbehaving REST endpoint trips an explicit error instead of hanging the worker thread. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.qq]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.qq` with `QQ_APP_ID` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and `QQ_APP_SECRET` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`); optional knobs are `QQ_ALLOWED_USERS`, `QQ_ACCOUNT_ID`, `QQ_INTENTS`. See `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/qq.py` header for the exact config. `ChannelType::Custom("qq")` is preserved via `channel_type = "qq"` on the sidecar entry so existing routing / `channel_role_mapping` keys continue to resolve. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_qq_adapter.py` (77 new tests) covers env-var enforcement (app_id/secret required, intents decimal+hex+garbage, ws-url override), `strip_markdown` (bold/italic/code/heading/link/quote/table-sep/HR/think-tags/triple-newlines collapse), `_parse_retry_after` (5 cases), `parse_qq_event` for all 4 event types + edge cases (empty/whitespace content, unknown type, non-dict data, allowlist accept/reject, bot-mention `/` strip vs slash-command, account_id injection, username fallback, missing msg_id), `_mark_seen` capacity eviction, `_fetch_token` / `_fetch_gateway` (happy path + 429-retry + non-200 + missing field), `_post_message` (basic shape, chunking, empty endpoint, omits msg_id when None, 429-retry-once, persistent-429 fail-open, 5xx fail-open keeps chunking), `on_send` (text, markdown stripping at on_send boundary, unsupported content → placeholder, empty endpoint, falls back to user.platform_id), and the WS gateway flow via a mock `_WebSocketClient` (HELLO → IDENTIFY token+intents+shard, DISPATCH emission, msg.id dedupe across two dispatches, RECONNECT op returns, INVALID_SESSION sleeps 3s and returns, heartbeat fires after interval).

The Rust adapter's inline base64 attachment support (`Image` / `Voice` / `Video` / `Audio` / `Animation` / `File` / `FileData` / `MediaGroup`) is not yet wired through the sidecar — non-text content currently degrades to a `(Unsupported content type)` placeholder; a follow-up will restore the base64 round-trip. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.signal]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.signal`.

The sidecar dedupes locally on `message.id` with a bounded `SEEN_MESSAGES_MAX = 10 000` / `SEEN_MESSAGES_EVICT = 5 000` cap (same policy as reddit / rocketchat / nextcloud / webex); (3) **explicit HTTP timeouts on every `urlopen`** — `urllib.request.urlopen` has no default timeout, so a hung LINE API would hang the worker thread forever; every call now passes `timeout=SEND_TIMEOUT_SECS` (15 s) so a misbehaving endpoint trips an explicit error. **Operator action required (substantive)**: the sidecar runs **its own HTTP webhook server** (default port `9090`, override via `LINE_WEBHOOK_PORT`; default path `/webhook`, override via `LINE_WEBHOOK_PATH`) — it is **no longer mounted on the LibreFang API port**, so the webhook URL you have registered at the LINE Developers Console must be updated to point at the sidecar host (typical pattern: an HTTPS reverse proxy in front of the sidecar's listening port). An existing `[channels.line]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.line` with `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` and `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (both in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`) plus any optional knobs (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`): `LINE_WEBHOOK_PORT`, `LINE_WEBHOOK_PATH`, `LINE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `LINE_BIND_HOST` (defaults to `0.0.0.0`). `ChannelType::Custom("line")` (the channel-type token the Rust adapter advertised at `line.rs:353-355`) is preserved across this migration via `channel_type = "line"` on the sidecar entry, so existing routing and `channel_role_mapping` keys that reference `line` continue to resolve. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_line_adapter.py` (68 new tests) covers env-var enforcement (whitespace-only secret/token still exits 2, port/path/account-id parsing, bind-host override, api_base override), `_split_message` chunking (under-limit, newline-cut, hard-cut, 5000 cap parity), `_parse_retry_after` (missing-uses-default, integer seconds, garbage-falls-back, 1 s floor, `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS` cap), `verify_line_signature` (round-trip happy path, wrong secret rejects, mutated body rejects, empty/whitespace/non-base64 signature rejects — regression for #3439, and the wire-bytes-vs-JSON-roundtrip regression which would otherwise have rejected every legitimate LINE webhook), `parse_line_event` (text user message, group `groupId` → reply_to mapping, room `roomId` → reply_to mapping, slash command with args, slash command no args, non-message event returns None, non-text message returns None, empty text returns None, missing source returns None, missing reply_token omitted from metadata, account_id metadata injection when present and omission when absent), `_mark_seen` (fresh vs repeat, empty id no-op, eviction at cap with parametrised small caps), `_validate_token` (200 happy path with auth-header + timeout assertions, 429-then-200 with `Retry-After` honoured, non-200 raises with status in the message, missing-displayName falls back to "LINE Bot"), `_push_text` + `_post_push` (single-chunk shape, multi-chunk one-call-per-chunk preservation, 429-then-200 with explicit Retry-After honoured, persistent 429 fail-open so the rest of a multi-chunk reply still ships), `_push_image` (image + caption two-call shape, no-caption single call, empty-URL skip), `_handle_webhook_body` (valid signature emits, invalid/missing signature returns 401, bad JSON returns 400, non-object body returns 400, empty events returns 200 for the LINE Developers Console URL-verification ping, dedupes repeated message ids, follow event leaves dedupe set empty so the next real text message is not silently dropped, account_id metadata injection on emitted events), `on_send` wiring (text, image, unsupported content → placeholder, empty platform_id drops silently, falls back to `user.platform_id` when `channel_id` is absent), and the `--describe` SCHEMA round-trip.

Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.zulip` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/zulip.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same `GET /api/v1/users/me` startup credential probe to discover the bot's stable integer `user_id` and `full_name`, same HTTP Basic auth on every REST call (`<bot_email>:<api_key>`), same event-queue register with `event_types=["message"]` + optional `narrow=[["stream", "<name>"], …]` when `ZULIP_STREAMS` is set, same long-poll `GET /api/v1/events` with `dont_block=false` and a 70 s HTTP timeout (matching the Rust `POLL_TIMEOUT_SECS + 10` budget at zulip.rs:244), same queue-expiry recovery on 400 + `code == "BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID"` re-register (mirrors zulip.rs:262-308), same client-side stream filter on `message.display_recipient` as defence-in-depth against the server-side narrow being best-effort, same slash-command routing on `/cmd args` → `Command` (text otherwise), same DM detection via `message.type == "private"` → `is_group = false` with platform_id falling back to sender email, same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection, same 10 000-char message chunking (`ZULIP_MSG_LIMIT` parity with the Rust `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN`), same outbound DM heuristic (`@` in `cmd.user.platform_id` ⇒ `type=direct`), same exponential reconnect backoff 1 s → 60 s. **Four improvements on top of the Rust adapter**: (1) **outbound topic round-trip via `thread_id`** — the Rust `send` at `crates/librefang-channels/src/zulip.rs` line 463 hard-coded `topic = "LibreFang"` for every stream reply, losing the inbound topic context so the bot's response always landed in a "LibreFang" topic regardless of which topic triggered it (a separate `send_in_thread` path at line 471 did pass `thread_id` through, but the kernel only reached it when the trigger explicitly carried a thread id; the common case dropped the topic). The sidecar surfaces the inbound `message.subject` as `thread_id` on inbound and `on_send` routes every stream send through that topic so the reply lands in the originating topic. Mirrors reddit / rocketchat / nextcloud / webex; (2) **429 `Retry-After` honoured on every REST path** — the Rust adapter had no 429 handling, only the generic 1 s → 60 s exponential backoff at zulip.rs:228-313; a server-side rate-limit either burned the poll budget or caused the send to return an Err. The sidecar's `_http` exposes response headers and `_parse_retry_after` floors at 1 s + caps at `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS` with a `RETRY_AFTER_DEFAULT_SECS = 30.0` fallback; `_validate`, `_register_queue`, `_poll_once`, and `_post_message` all detect 429, sleep the indicated interval, then retry (poll raises so the producer's outer backoff applies; send raises only on a second 429 inside the same call). Same pattern as the merged `fix(channels): honour Retry-After across sidecar polling adapters` #5303; (3) **bounded `message.id` dedupe** — Zulip's `last_event_id` cursor narrows the *event* range server-side, but on queue re-register (`BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID`) the bot can re-see a message it already emitted because the new queue starts fresh. The Rust emit at zulip.rs:434 was unconditional. The sidecar dedupes locally on `message.id` with a bounded `SEEN_MESSAGES_MAX = 10 000` / `SEEN_MESSAGES_EVICT = 5 000` cap (same policy as reddit / rocketchat / nextcloud / webex); (4) **self-skip by stable integer `sender_id`** — the Rust adapter compared `sender_email == bot_email` (zulip.rs:357). Email is the bot's outward identifier and rarely rotates, but on realms that change bot ownership the email moves while the integer `user_id` stays — the email-only check breaks. The sidecar prefers `sender_id == own_user_id` (the integer `/users/me` returns) and falls back to `sender_email == own_email` when `sender_id` is absent (parallels the rocketchat #5298 / nextcloud #5301 fix). New env-var knobs (read from `[sidecar_channels.env]`): `ZULIP_SERVER_URL` (replaces `server_url`), `ZULIP_BOT_EMAIL` (replaces `bot_email`), optional `ZULIP_STREAMS` (comma-separated stream names, empty = all subscribed), optional `ZULIP_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.zulip]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.zulip` with `ZULIP_SERVER_URL` + `ZULIP_BOT_EMAIL` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and `ZULIP_API_KEY` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`) — see the module's header for the exact config. `ChannelType::Custom("zulip")` (the channel-type token the Rust adapter advertised at zulip.rs:197) is preserved across this migration via `channel_type = "zulip"` on the sidecar entry, so existing routing and `channel_role_mapping` keys that reference `zulip` continue to resolve. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_zulip_adapter.py` (74 new tests) covers env-var enforcement (server URL trailing-slash strip + scheme validation, whitespace-only api-key still exits 2), comma-separated stream parse, account-id optional, `_split_message` chunking (under-limit, newline-cut, hard-cut, 10000 cap parity), `_split_csv`, `_parse_retry_after` (missing-uses-default, integer/decimal seconds, garbage-falls-back, 1 s floor, `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS` cap), `_auth_headers` Basic-auth shape with optional form Content-Type, `parse_zulip_event` (basic stream message, basic DM falls back to sender email + no thread, slash-command form with/without args, self-skip by stable sender_id even when email rotates, fallback to email when sender_id absent, non-self with different id is NOT skipped, self-skip disabled when both keys missing, stream filter accept/reject/empty-all, account_id injection, non-message event types skipped, empty content skipped, missing sender_full_name → "unknown", string sender_id coerced, malformed event / message dict → None), `_mark_seen` (first-time / repeat suppress / empty-id always fresh / capacity eviction at cap), `_validate` (happy path + 401 raise + missing user_id raise + 429 retry-after), `_register_queue` (basic body shape with event_types JSON literal, with-streams includes `narrow` JSON, 4xx raise, 429 retry with explicit Retry-After, 429 without header falls back to default), `_poll_once` (emit, id-repeat dedupe across two polls, `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` returns `reregister` signal without raising, other 400 codes raise, 429 sleeps then raises, watermark advances to max event.id in batch, long-poll timeout 70 s passed, non-message events still advance watermark), `_post_message` (stream form shape with topic, direct shape with URL-encoded @, multi-chunk for long bodies, 429 retry-once with explicit Retry-After, double-429 raises, 5xx raises, missing destination rejection), `on_send` wiring (uses `cmd.thread_id` as stream topic — the P1 improvement, falls back to `DEFAULT_STREAM_TOPIC = "LibreFang"` when absent, DM via `@` in platform_id, falls back to `channel_id` when `user` is None, non-text content → placeholder), SCHEMA advertises required fields, `suppress_error_responses = False` (chat-room precedent), `capabilities = ["thread"]`.

- **BREAKING: Webex migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::webex` adapter (`WebexAdapter`, 645 lines: Cisco Mercury WebSocket gateway at `wss://mercury-connection-a.wbx2.com/v1/apps/wx2/registrations` for activity events + `GET /messages/<id>` REST follow-up for the message body + `POST /messages` publish, auth via bot Bearer token) is deleted along with the `[channels.webex]` config schema (`WebexConfig`), the `channel-webex` cargo feature in both `librefang-channels` and `librefang-api` (incl. its membership in `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email`), the dashboard `ChannelMeta` descriptor + 4 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser`), the CLI-TUI `ChannelDef`, the kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` entry + `EXPECTED` name-list, and the config-validation env-var hook. `webex` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` now permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process webex adapter. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.webex` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/webex.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same `GET /people/me` startup credential probe to discover the bot's own id + display name, same hard-coded Mercury WSS endpoint with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on the upgrade request (no device-registration handshake — Cisco's gateway accepts the bare connect), same `data.activity` envelope parsing with verb=="post" filter and actor-id self-skip, same `GET /messages/<id>` REST follow-up to retrieve the full message body, same room-filter behaviour (empty allowlist = all rooms the bot is in), same slash-command routing on `/cmd args` → `Command` (text otherwise), same `roomType == "group"` → `is_group` mapping, same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection, same 7439-char message chunking (`WEBEX_MSG_LIMIT` parity with the Rust `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN`), same exponential reconnect backoff (1s → 60s). The WebSocket client is the same hand-rolled RFC 6455 reader as the discord / slack / nextcloud sidecars — `select`-gated frame waits, masked-pong replies to server pings, close-frame handling. The Rust adapter also carried a never-wired `register_webhook` helper (`webex.rs:137-168`, marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`) for an HTTP-webhook delivery alternative the channel-bridge never enabled; the sidecar drops it without replacement, since the canonical webhook-delivery path is now the generic `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `librefang.sidecar.adapters.webhook`. Inbound `personDisplayName` (when the `/messages/<id>` body carries it) now drives `user_name` instead of the Rust adapter's unconditional `personEmail` (`webex.rs:431`), so bot logs and dashboard UI surface "Alice" rather than "alice@example.com" — `personEmail` is still preserved in metadata for routing / audit and used as the fallback when `personDisplayName` is absent. **Four improvements on top of the Rust adapter**: (1) **`parentId` outbound threading wired** — the Rust `api_send_message` (`crates/librefang-channels/src/webex.rs` lines 171-201 on the migrating tree) built a body of just `{"roomId", "text"}`, so Webex's `parentId` field (which threads a reply under a parent message in a Space) was never sent; the inbound side dropped the message id entirely (`thread_id: None` at line 438 of the same file), so even when we knew the parent we had nothing to round-trip. The sidecar surfaces the inbound `id` (or the inbound `parentId` when the user themselves was already inside a thread, so the bot threads alongside rather than starting a nested child) as `thread_id`, and `on_send` posts `parentId` populated so threaded replies actually thread — mirrors reddit / rocketchat / nextcloud / mastodon / bluesky; (2) **429 `Retry-After` honoured on both fetch and send** — Webex documents 429 with `Retry-After`, but the Rust adapter had no 429 handling at either `GET /messages/<id>` (`webex.rs:380-398`) or `POST /messages` (`webex.rs:171-201`); a server-side rate-limit either lost the inbound fetch or caused `send()` to return an `Err` and drop the outbound. The sidecar parses `Retry-After` (with a `RETRY_AFTER_DEFAULT_SECS = 30.0` fallback, floor 1 s, cap `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`), sleeps, and retries once before logging-and-continuing on the second 429 (same fail-open shape as the discord / slack 429-retry pattern, matching `fix(channels): honour Retry-After across sidecar polling adapters` #5303); (3) **Mercury activity-id dedupe** — Mercury can re-deliver an `activity.object.id` on reconnect (the Rust adapter had no dedupe, see the unconditional emit at `webex.rs:459` — the only filters were verb / self / empty-id / allowed-rooms); operators with a flaky network saw the bot react twice to the same message after a transient drop. The sidecar dedupes locally on `activity.object.id` with a bounded `SEEN_MESSAGES_MAX = 10 000` / `SEEN_MESSAGES_EVICT = 5 000` cap (same policy as reddit / rocketchat / nextcloud); (4) **explicit HTTP timeouts on every `urlopen`** — `urllib.request.urlopen` has no default timeout, so a hung Webex API would hang the producer thread forever; every `_http` call now passes `timeout=SEND_TIMEOUT_SECS` (15 s) so a misbehaving REST endpoint trips an explicit error and loops the reconnect backoff instead of hanging. New env-var knobs (read from `[sidecar_channels.env]`): `WEBEX_ALLOWED_ROOMS` (comma-separated room IDs, empty = allow all), optional `WEBEX_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.webex]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.webex` with `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`) and any of the optional knobs above (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`). `ChannelType::Custom("webex")` (the channel-type token the Rust adapter advertised at `webex.rs:258`) is preserved across this migration via `channel_type = "webex"` on the sidecar entry, so existing routing and `channel_role_mapping` keys that reference `webex` continue to resolve. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_webex_adapter.py` (78 new tests) covers env-var enforcement (whitespace-only token still exits 2, allowed-rooms CSV with whitespace, account-id passthrough, api_base / ws_url overrides), `_split_message` chunking (under-limit, newline-cut, hard-cut, 7439 cap parity), `_split_csv`, `_parse_retry_after` (missing-uses-default, integer/decimal seconds, garbage-falls-back, 1 s floor, `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS` cap), `parse_webex_message` (basic text, non-post verb skip, self-actor skip with own_bot_id-None bypass, missing object id, empty text, room-filter accept/reject/empty-all, command form with/without args, DM roomType=direct → not group, account_id injection, thread-reply uses inbound `parentId` and top-level uses own id, roomType=missing defaults to group, missing personEmail/personId fallbacks, full-msg roomId fallback to activity.target.id, malformed activity / msg), `_mark_seen` dedupe (first-time / repeat / empty-id / capacity eviction at cap), `_validate_bot_token` (happy path + 4 fail cases + 429 retry-after on the auth probe), `_fetch_message` (happy path with URL-quoting of special chars, non-2xx returns None, 429 retries with explicit Retry-After then default, double-429 returns None), `_post_message` (basic shape, `parentId` round-trip, chunks preserve `parentId`, 429 retry with explicit + default, double-429 fail-open continues with remaining chunks, 5xx fail-open, explicit timeout passed on every `urlopen`), `_handle_envelope` end-to-end (full flow with REST follow-up, self-skip without REST call, non-post verb skip without REST call, room-filter skip without REST call, dedupes repeated activity ids so only one REST fetch happens per id, account_id injection, fetch failure drops without crash, malformed payloads), `on_send` wiring (uses `channel_id`, falls back to `user.platform_id`, round-trips `thread_id` as `parentId`, non-text content placeholder, drops on empty room id), and SCHEMA / capabilities.

Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.nextcloud` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/nextcloud.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same `GET /ocs/v2.php/cloud/user` startup credential probe, same per-room `chat/<token>?lookIntoFuture=1` polling at the same 3 s default interval, same empty-allowlist → `apps/spreed/api/v4/room` auto-discovery of joined rooms, same Bearer + `OCS-APIRequest: true` headers, same slash-command routing on `/cmd args` → `Command` (text otherwise), same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection, same 32000-char message chunking, same per-room transport-error isolation, same 304-as-no-op handling of Talk's long-poll-expired response. **Three improvements on top of the Rust adapter**: (1) **outbound threading is now actually wired** — the Rust adapter's `api_send_message` (`crates/librefang-channels/src/nextcloud.rs` lines 130-160 on main) called `POST /chat/<token>` with a body of just `{"message": ...}`, so Talk's `replyTo` form parameter (which links a reply to a parent message id) was never sent and chunked / threaded replies always landed at the room root regardless of inbound context; the sidecar surfaces the inbound `id` (or the inbound `parentMessage.id` when the user themselves was already inside a thread, so the bot threads alongside rather than starting a child) as `thread_id`, and `on_send` posts `replyTo` populated so the reply threads correctly — mirrors reddit / bluesky / mastodon / rocketchat; (2) **self-skip on `(actorType, actorId)` rather than `actorId` alone** — the Rust adapter compared `msg["actorId"] == own_user` (nextcloud.rs:338 on main) without inspecting `actorType`, so a Talk guest / `federated_users` actor whose id happens to equal the bot's user id would silently spoof self-skip and the bot would ignore the guest's messages; the sidecar requires `actorType == "users"` AND `actorId == own_user_id`, eliminating the ambiguity (parallels the rocketchat #5298 fix); (3) **dedupe set on `id`** — the Rust adapter advanced `last_known_ids` (nextcloud.rs:347-354 on main) but only relied on the server-side `lastKnownMessageId` cursor for deduplication; under retry / re-poll boundaries Talk can resend the same id (e.g. when the previous fetch's response was lost but the newest-id update wasn't persisted client-side), re-emitting messages. The sidecar keeps the watermark for the API query but additionally dedupes locally on `id` with a bounded `SEEN_MESSAGES_MAX=10000` / `SEEN_MESSAGES_EVICT=5000` cap (same policy as reddit / rocketchat). Additionally, the sidecar marks `suppress_error_responses = true` (Talk rooms are typically multi-participant, same rationale as mastodon / bluesky / reddit / rocketchat). New env-var knobs: `NEXTCLOUD_SERVER_URL` (replaces `server_url`), optional `NEXTCLOUD_ROOMS` (comma-separated room-token list, empty = auto-discover joined rooms via the spreed v4 room endpoint), optional `NEXTCLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing, optional `NEXTCLOUD_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` (default 3, floor 1). **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.nextcloud]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.nextcloud` with env var `NEXTCLOUD_SERVER_URL` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and `NEXTCLOUD_TOKEN` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`) — see the module's header for the exact config. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_nextcloud_adapter.py` (58 new tests) covers env-var enforcement, server URL normalization (trailing-slash strip, scheme validation), poll-interval clamping, `_split_message` chunking (under-limit, newline-cut, hard-cut, 32000 cap parity), `_verify_credentials` (OCS + Bearer header shape, 401, missing-id fallback), `apps/spreed/api/v4/room` discovery, `_parse_message` (basic text, thread-reply uses inbound `parentMessage.id`, string-vs-int parent id, self-skip on `(actorType,actorId)`, guest-with-matching-id is NOT self, self-skip disabled when own_user_id empty, system-message skip, empty-body skip, command form, no-args command, `referenceId` in metadata, malformed input, non-integer id graceful handling), `_poll_once` (emit + watermark advance, dedupe across id repeats, self-skip still marks seen, `account_id` injection, 401 raises, 304 no-op, per-room transport-error isolation, 500 logged-and-skipped, URL + auth-header shape with `lookIntoFuture=1` / `limit=100` / `lastKnownMessageId=<wm>` / `format=json`), dedupe-set capacity eviction at cap and idempotent mark + empty-id ignore, `_post_message` (basic form-encoded shape with `message`, `replyTo` on thread, multi-chunk preserves `replyTo`, missing-room rejection, non-2xx surfaced), `on_send` wiring (uses `cmd.user.platform_id` as room token, threads via `thread_id`, falls back to `cmd.channel_id`, non-text content → placeholder). (@vip)
- **REGRESSION (acknowledged, matches the telegram / discord precedent): live Slack workspace-role RBAC is unavailable in the sidecar.** The Rust `SlackAdapter` implemented `ChannelRoleQuery::lookup_role` by calling `users.info` on every message and collapsing `is_primary_owner` / `is_owner` / `is_admin` / `is_restricted` / `is_ultra_restricted` into one of `owner` / `admin` / `guest` / `member`, which the kernel then translated through `[channel_role_mapping.slack]` into a LibreFang `UserRole`. `ChannelRoleQuery` is a Rust trait the sidecar process cannot implement, so post-migration `role_query.is_none()` for Slack, the kernel's `resolve_role_for_sender` falls through to the default-deny branch, and `[channel_role_mapping.slack]` (static config) is never consulted. Operators who relied on automatic workspace-role-to-LibreFang-role mapping see every Slack user fall back to `Viewer` unless explicitly added under `[users]`. Same situation telegram has been in since #5241 and discord since #5299; flagged here so operators aren't surprised by the silent demotion. (Workaround: enumerate authorised operators under `[users]` with `channel_bindings = { slack = ["<slack_user_id>"] }` and an explicit `role`.) The `parse_users_info` precedence parser is preserved in `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/slack.py` so a future sidecar-protocol query/response pair can reuse it without re-deriving the logic.

- **BREAKING: Slack migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::slack` adapter (`SlackAdapter`, 1 890 lines: Socket Mode WebSocket via `apps.connections.open` + Web API via `chat.postMessage` / `reactions.add` / `users.info`) is deleted along with the `[channels.slack]` config schema (`SlackConfig`), the `channel-slack` cargo feature (incl. its membership in `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email` / `core-channels` / `mini`), the dashboard `ChannelMeta` descriptor + 5 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser` / `is_channel_configured`), the CLI `librefang channel setup slack` wizard arm + `channel list` row, the kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` entry + `EXPECTED` name-list, the config-validation env-var hook, and the `routes/channels.rs` live-test `slack` branch that POSTed to `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`. `slack` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` now permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process slack adapter. The canonical `deny_unknown_fields` rustdoc anchor (#5130) moves to `WhatsAppConfig`. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.slack` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/slack.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same `POST /api/auth.test` startup probe to discover `bot_user_id`, same `POST /api/apps.connections.open` to mint a Socket Mode WSS URL, same envelope-id ACK loop for `events_api` / `interactive`, same `message` + `app_mention` event handling with `message_changed` subtype extraction and all-other-subtype skip, same self-skip on `bot_id` presence OR `user == bot_user_id`, same `allowed_channels` filter with DM exemption (channels starting with `D`), same slash-command routing on `/cmd args` → `Command`, same `thread_ts` capture as `thread_id`, same DM detection via channel-id prefix, same `block_actions` interactive payload → `ButtonCallback` content with `action_id` / `trigger_id` / `block_action` metadata, same `chat.postMessage` send with optional `thread_ts` + `unfurl_links` + Block Kit blocks, same 3 000-char chunking (`SLACK_MSG_LIMIT` parity), same `eyes` reaction on receive flipped to `white_check_mark` on send-complete (opt-out via `SLACK_REACTIONS=false`), same `force_flat_replies` knob to post replies as top-level channel messages instead of threads, same `sender_user_id` metadata key (`SENDER_USER_ID_KEY` parity), same account-id injection for multi-bot routing. The Block Kit `_build_block_kit` builder mirrors the Rust adapter's section + actions block layout (one section for the text, one actions block per row of buttons, `primary` / `danger` style validation, `url` button passthrough, malformed-row skip). The WebSocket client is the same hand-rolled RFC 6455 reader as the discord sidecar (#5299) — `select`-gated frame waits, masked-pong replies to server pings, close-frame handling. **One improvement on top of the Rust adapter**: **pending-reaction map is bounded** at `MAX_PENDING_REACTIONS = 2 000` entries with oldest-eviction; the Rust adapter used an unbounded `RwLock<HashMap>` so a flood of inbound messages followed by a hang in the agent loop would grow the map without bound (a small but real memory-leak surface that the eviction now closes). **Two regressions to call out alongside the parity claim** (matching the discord precedent #5299): (a) live Slack workspace-role RBAC is gone (see the dedicated regression entry above — `ChannelRoleQuery::lookup_role` was Rust-trait-bound and cannot cross the sidecar boundary; `[channel_role_mapping.slack]` is no longer consulted because `role_query` is now `None` for Slack); (b) the per-`[channels.slack] proxy = "..."` override (#4795) is no longer wired through — the sidecar honours standard `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` env vars via Python stdlib but the per-channel override key has no `SLACK_PROXY_URL` env var yet (filed as a follow-up; operators with a per-channel proxy today should fall back to the process-wide env vars). New env-var knobs (read from `[sidecar_channels.env]`): `SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS` (comma-separated channel IDs, empty = allow all), `SLACK_UNFURL_LINKS` (tri-state — unset = use Slack default, `true` / `false` to force), `SLACK_FORCE_FLAT_REPLIES` (default false), `SLACK_REACTIONS` (default true), optional `SLACK_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.slack]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.slack` with `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`) and any of the optional knobs above (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`). The OpenClaw migrator (`librefang-migrate::openclaw`) now emits a `SkippedItem` with a sidecar-redirect message instead of writing `[channels.slack]` to the migrated config (mirrors how telegram + discord were handled). `ChannelType::Slack` enum variant stays — it is used by the router / bridge for routing logic and is preserved across this migration the same way `ChannelType::Telegram` and `ChannelType::Discord` were preserved. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest` (488 tests, 72 new for slack) covers env handling (xapp + xoxb required, tri-state unfurl_links, force-flat-replies + reactions defaults, allowed-channels splitting), `_split_message` chunking, `_split_csv` / `_bool_env`, `parse_users_info` precedence (owner > admin > guest > member; `user_not_found` returns silent `None`), `parse_slack_event` (basic text, app_mention sets was_mentioned, self-skip via bot_id + user_id, message_changed subtype extraction, drops other subtypes, slash-command routing, empty-text drop, allowed-channels filter with DM exemption, thread_ts capture, account_id injection), `parse_slack_block_action` (basic shape with message_text / action_id / trigger_id / block_action metadata, drops non-block_actions type, drops self-user, drops empty action value, respects allowed_channels), `_validate_bot_token` (auth.test happy path, rejection on `ok: false`, missing user_id surface), `_fetch_socket_mode_url` (apps.connections.open shape using app-level token, rejection on `ok: false`, non-wss URL rejection), `_post_message` (channel + text + thread_ts + unfurl_links + Block Kit blocks shape, 3000-char chunking, fail-open on `ok: false`, fail-open on 5xx), `_build_block_kit` (section-first, primary/danger style validation, url passthrough, malformed-row skip), reactions (`already_reacted` / `no_reaction` benign-silence, disabled-noop, pending-reactions bounded cap, eyes → white_check_mark flip on finalize), `_handle_envelope` state machine (events_api ACK + emit + eyes reaction, interactive ACK + ButtonCallback emit, hello no-op, disconnect raises, skipped events still ACK but no emit), `on_send` routing (text uses channel_id, thread_ts wiring, force_flat_replies drops thread, Interactive uses Block Kit, unsupported content placeholder, user.platform_id fallback, drops on empty channel_id). Also `cargo test -p librefang-channels -p librefang-types -p librefang-migrate -p librefang-kernel -p librefang-api --features 'librefang-api/all-channels'` runs clean (lib + integration) and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --features 'librefang-api/all-channels' -- -D warnings` is zero-warning.

Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.rocketchat` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/rocketchat.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same `GET /api/v1/me` startup credential probe, same per-room `channels.history` polling at the same 2 s default interval, same empty-allowlist → `channels.list.joined` auto-discovery, same `X-Auth-Token` / `X-User-Id` auth headers, same slash-command routing on `/cmd args` → `Command` (text otherwise), same multi-bot `account_id` metadata injection, same 4096-char message chunking, same per-room transport-error isolation. **Three improvements on top of the Rust adapter**: (1) **outbound threading is now actually wired** — the Rust adapter captured the inbound `tmid` on receive but `send()` always called `chat.sendMessage` without forwarding it, so threaded replies broke and the bot's responses landed at the room root regardless of context; the sidecar surfaces the inbound `_id` (or the inbound `tmid` when the user themselves was already inside a thread, so the bot threads alongside rather than starting a child) as `thread_id`, and `on_send` calls `POST /api/v1/chat.postMessage` with `tmid` populated so the reply threads correctly — mirrors reddit / bluesky / mastodon (see `crates/librefang-channels/src/rocketchat.rs` lines 297, 304-340 in main for the captured-but-unused `tmid` field, and `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/rocketchat.py` `_parse_message` / `_post_message` for the round-trip); (2) **dedupe set on `_id`** — the Rust adapter advanced its per-room `last_timestamps` cursor on RFC3339 string comparison and re-fetched `oldest=<watermark>`, which with `count=50` and same-`ts` repeats either re-emitted duplicates or silently dropped messages that shared a timestamp boundary (see `crates/librefang-channels/src/rocketchat.rs` lines 280-302 in main); the sidecar keeps the watermark for the API query but additionally dedupes on `msg._id` with a bounded `SEEN_MESSAGES_MAX=10000` / `SEEN_MESSAGES_EVICT=5000` cap (same policy as reddit); (3) **self-skip by stable user id** — the Rust adapter compared `u.username == own_username` (`crates/librefang-channels/src/rocketchat.rs` line 285 in main), which silently breaks when the bot's display name rotates; the sidecar compares `u._id == ROCKETCHAT_USER_ID` (the stable internal id the operator already configured) and falls back to username only when the inbound shape omits `u._id`. Additionally, the sidecar marks `suppress_error_responses = true` (Rocket.Chat messages are public to a room, same rationale as mastodon / bluesky / reddit). New env-var knobs: `ROCKETCHAT_SERVER_URL` (replaces `server_url`), `ROCKETCHAT_USER_ID` (replaces `user_id`), optional `ROCKETCHAT_CHANNELS` (comma-separated room id list, empty = auto-discover joined channels), optional `ROCKETCHAT_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing, optional `ROCKETCHAT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` (default 2, floor 1). **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.rocketchat]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.rocketchat` with env vars `ROCKETCHAT_SERVER_URL`, `ROCKETCHAT_USER_ID` (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`) and `ROCKETCHAT_TOKEN` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`) — see the module's header for the exact config. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_rocketchat_adapter.py` (54 new tests) covers env-var enforcement, server URL normalization (trailing-slash strip, scheme validation), poll-interval clamping, `_split_message` chunking (under-limit, newline-cut, hard-cut, 4096 cap parity), `_verify_credentials` (auth header shape, 401, missing-username fallback), `channels.list.joined` discovery, `_parse_message` (basic text, thread-reply uses inbound `tmid`, self-skip by user id, username-fallback when `u._id` missing, empty-body skip, command form, no-args command, malformed input), `_poll_once` (emit + watermark advance, dedupe across same-`ts` repeats, self-skip still marks seen, `account_id` injection, 401 raises, per-room transport-error isolation, 500 logged-and-skipped, URL + auth-header shape), dedupe-set capacity eviction at cap and idempotent mark + empty-id ignore, `_post_message` (basic shape with `roomId` + `text`, `tmid` on thread, multi-chunk preserves `tmid`, missing-room rejection, non-2xx surfaced, soft-error `success=false` logged), `on_send` wiring (uses `cmd.user.platform_id` as room, threads via `thread_id`, falls back to `cmd.channel_id`, non-text content → placeholder).

- **BREAKING: Twitch migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::twitch` adapter (`TwitchAdapter`, 535 lines: plaintext TCP to `irc.chat.twitch.tv:6667`, raw IRC handshake `PASS oauth:<token>` / `NICK` / `JOIN #channel`, hand-rolled `parse_privmsg`, per-send fresh-TCP-connect dance) is deleted along with the `[channels.twitch]` config schema (`TwitchConfig`), the `channel-twitch` cargo feature (incl. its membership in `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email`), the dashboard `ChannelMeta` descriptor + 4 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser`), the CLI-TUI `ChannelDef`, the kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` entry + `EXPECTED` name-list, and the config-validation env-var hook. `twitch` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` now permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process twitch adapter. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.twitch` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/twitch.py`, stdlib-only — `socket` + `ssl` + `threading`, no third-party deps): same OAuth `PASS` / `NICK` handshake (with the `oauth:` prefix auto-added when absent), same `JOIN #<channel>` for each configured channel, same PRIVMSG → ChannelMessage path with self-skip on case-insensitive nick match, same `/cmd` / `!cmd` routing to `Content::Command`, same PING → PONG keepalive, same `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN = 500` chunking, same exponential reconnect backoff (1s → 60s), same `account_id` multi-bot routing via `TWITCH_ACCOUNT_ID`. **Three improvements on top of the Rust adapter**: (1) **TLS by default** — the sidecar connects to `irc.chat.twitch.tv:6697` and wraps the socket with `ssl.create_default_context()`; the Rust adapter used plaintext `6667` (hard-coded as `TWITCH_IRC_PORT` in `crates/librefang-channels/src/twitch.rs:24`) and sent the OAuth token in cleartext on every connect, a credential-leak-on-wire that operators get fixed automatically on upgrade. Plaintext is reachable only via `TWITCH_PLAINTEXT=1` for local mock listeners (tests use this); (2) **per-message reply threading via IRCv3 tags** — the sidecar issues `CAP REQ :twitch.tv/tags twitch.tv/commands` after auth, parses the `@…` tag block on every PRIVMSG, surfaces `@id` as `thread_id` so the daemon round-trips it back via `cmd.thread_id`, and attaches `@reply-parent-msg-id=<id>` on outbound PRIVMSG so Twitch renders the bot's response threaded under the source message. The Rust adapter never requested any IRCv3 capability and discarded any tag block, so chunked replies arrived as a flat sequence of unthreaded messages (matches the bluesky #5277 improvement); (3) **ban-avoidance token bucket on outbound** — Twitch's anti-spam logic drops the bot from chat above 20 msgs / 30 s for a non-mod account (100 / 30 s for a mod). The Rust adapter shipped zero throttling — every PRIVMSG hit the wire immediately, so a chatty agent in a busy channel would be silently dropped. The sidecar gates every outbound chunk through an in-process token bucket (defaults `20 / 30 s`, override via `TWITCH_RATE_LIMIT_MSGS` / `TWITCH_RATE_LIMIT_SECS`). New env-var knobs: `TWITCH_NICK`, `TWITCH_CHANNELS` (comma-separated, no `#`), optional `TWITCH_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing, optional `TWITCH_RATE_LIMIT_MSGS` / `TWITCH_RATE_LIMIT_SECS` to tune the bucket, optional `TWITCH_PLAINTEXT` / `TWITCH_HOST` / `TWITCH_PORT` test escape hatches. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.twitch]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.twitch` with env vars `TWITCH_NICK`, `TWITCH_CHANNELS` (config table) and `TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN` (`~/.librefang/secrets.env`) — see the module's header for the exact config. Verification: `cd sdk/python && python -m pytest tests/test_twitch_adapter.py` (68 new tests) covers env-var enforcement, channel name normalization (`#`/whitespace/case), `_split_message` chunking, IRC tag-block parsing with IRCv3 escapes, IRC line parsing (PRIVMSG with/without tags, PING, CAP ACK, ERROR-only), token-bucket starts-full-and-drains/blocks-when-empty/capacity-floor, slash- and bang-command routing, self-skip case-insensitive, dedupe by `@id` tag with capped eviction, account_id metadata injection, reply-parent metadata round-trip, PRIVMSG output shape (plain + threaded + chunked + channel-normalised), `_pass_string` auto-prefix, PING→PONG response, end-to-end `_connect()` against a local TCP listener asserting `CAP REQ` precedes `PASS` precedes `NICK` precedes ordered `JOIN`s (improvement #2), supervisor backoff on connect failure, on_send channel fallback (`channel_id` then `user.platform_id`) and unsupported-content placeholder, shutdown idempotence, `--describe` schema. (@vip)
- **REGRESSION (acknowledged, matches the telegram precedent #5241): live Discord-guild-role RBAC is unavailable in the sidecar.** The Rust `DiscordAdapter` implemented `ChannelRoleQuery::lookup_role` (Discord channel ID → guild ID → guild member roles → translate via `[channel_role_mapping.discord]`), and the kernel's `resolve_role_for_sender` invoked it on every message so a user's live Discord guild roles could promote them above the default-deny `Viewer`. `ChannelRoleQuery` is a Rust trait the sidecar process cannot implement, so post-migration `role_query.is_none()` for Discord, the kernel falls through to the default-deny branch, and `[channel_role_mapping.discord]` (static config) is never consulted. Operators who relied on automatic guild-role-to-LibreFang-role mapping see every Discord user fall back to `Viewer` unless explicitly added under `[users]`. Same situation telegram has been in since #5241; flagged here so operators aren't surprised by the silent demotion. (Workaround: enumerate authorised operators under `[users]` with `channel_bindings = { discord = ["<discord_user_id>"] }` and an explicit `role`.) Re-introducing live role lookup for sidecar adapters is a separate roadmap item — it needs a sidecar-protocol query/response pair the kernel can drive over stdio. (@houko)
- **BREAKING: Discord migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::discord` adapter (`DiscordAdapter`, 1 747 lines: Discord Gateway WebSocket v10 + REST API v10) is deleted along with the `[channels.discord]` config schema (`DiscordConfig`), the `channel-discord` cargo feature (incl. its membership in `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email` / `core-channels` / `mini`), the dashboard `ChannelMeta` descriptor + 5 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser` / `is_channel_configured`), the CLI `librefang channel setup discord` wizard arm + `channel list` row, the kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` entry + `EXPECTED` name-list, the config-validation env-var hook, and the `routes/channels.rs` live-test `discord` branch that POSTed to `https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/{id}/messages`. `discord` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` now permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process discord adapter. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.discord` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/discord.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same `GET /gateway/bot` URL discovery + WSS connect with `?v=10&encoding=json`, same opcode handling (HELLO/IDENTIFY/RESUME/HEARTBEAT/HEARTBEAT_ACK/RECONNECT/INVALID_SESSION/DISPATCH), same READY-driven `(bot_user_id, session_id, resume_gateway_url)` capture, same MESSAGE_CREATE / MESSAGE_UPDATE → `message` event mapping with self-skip via `bot_user_id`, `ignore_bots` filter, `allowed_users` / `allowed_guilds` whitelists, attachment-takes-priority-over-slash-command content extraction (Image/Video/Voice/File by MIME prefix, with audio/file warn-and-drop on companion text matching the Rust adapter), discriminator-aware display name (`username` for new-style or `username#discriminator` for legacy users), mention detection via `mentions[]` array + `<@bot_id>` / `<@!bot_id>` content tags + case-insensitive `mention_patterns`, `is_group = guild_id.is_some()`, `was_mentioned` metadata flag, `POST /channels/{id}/messages` with 2 000-UTF-16-unit chunking, `POST /channels/{id}/typing` for typing indicators, account-id injection into message metadata for multi-bot routing. The WebSocket client is a hand-rolled RFC 6455 reader on `socket` + `ssl` (no third-party WS lib) — `select`-gated frame waits keep mid-frame reads from racing with heartbeat ticks, server pings get a masked pong reply, and known-fatal close codes (4004 auth, 4013 invalid intents, 4014 disallowed intents) raise rather than reconnect so the supervisor's circuit-breaker stops a hard config error instead of looping. **Two improvements on top of the Rust adapter**: (1) **periodic client-side heartbeats**. The Rust adapter captured `heartbeat_interval` from HELLO but never spawned a heartbeat task — connections silently dropped after ~45 s with `code=4000` and re-IDENTIFY'd, losing the session every minute. The sidecar runs proper periodic heartbeats (with the RFC-mandated random jitter on the first beat) so sessions actually survive long-running idle periods, which then makes RESUME after a transient disconnect work for the first time; (2) **429 retry-with-`Retry-After`**. The Rust adapter's `api_send_message` warned on 429 and returned `Ok(())` (fail-open silent message loss); the sidecar honours `Retry-After` and retries once before logging-and-continuing on the second 429 (same fail-open behaviour for the unrecoverable case, but the recoverable case now actually delivers). **Two regressions to call out alongside the parity claim**: (a) live Discord-guild-role RBAC is gone (see the dedicated regression entry above — `ChannelRoleQuery::lookup_role` was Rust-trait-bound and cannot cross the sidecar boundary; `[channel_role_mapping.discord]` is no longer consulted because `role_query` is now `None` for Discord); (b) the per-`[channels.discord] proxy = "..."` override (#4795) is no longer wired through — the sidecar honours standard `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` env vars via Python stdlib (`urllib.request.ProxyHandler` default) but the per-channel override key has no `DISCORD_PROXY_URL` env var yet (filed as a follow-up; operators with a per-channel proxy today should fall back to the process-wide env vars). New env-var knobs (read from `[sidecar_channels.env]`): `DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILDS` (comma-separated guild IDs, empty = allow all), `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` (comma-separated user IDs), `DISCORD_INTENTS` (default 37376 = GUILD_MESSAGES | DIRECT_MESSAGES | MESSAGE_CONTENT), `DISCORD_IGNORE_BOTS` (default `true`), `DISCORD_MENTION_PATTERNS` (comma-separated case-insensitive substrings), optional `DISCORD_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.discord]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.discord` with env var `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` (in `~/.librefang/secrets.env`) and any of the optional knobs above (in `[sidecar_channels.env]`). The OpenClaw migrator (`librefang-migrate::openclaw`) now emits a `SkippedItem` with a sidecar-redirect message instead of writing `[channels.discord]` to the migrated config (mirrors how telegram migration handled the same case). `ChannelType::Discord` enum variant stays — it is used by the router / bridge for routing logic and is preserved across this migration the same way `ChannelType::Telegram` was preserved in #5241. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest` (293 tests, 68 new for discord) covers env handling, `_split_to_utf16_chunks` (ASCII / emoji surrogate-pair / exact boundary), `_split_csv` / `_parse_retry_after`, `parse_attachment` (image with caption / video / audio drops companion text / file fallback / missing-URL fallback / empty list), `parse_message_create` (self-skip via bot_user_id, `ignore_bots` filter with self-skip still firing when `ignore_bots=false`, `allowed_users` / `allowed_guilds` filters, slash command with/without args, attachment-takes-priority-over-command, mention via array / content tag / custom pattern, discriminator legacy format, DM not-group, account_id injection), `_handle_payload` state machine (READY captures session, INVALID_SESSION non-resumable clears state vs resumable preserves it, RECONNECT raises, MESSAGE_CREATE / MESSAGE_UPDATE emit, server-initiated heartbeat responds with `last_seq`, fatal close-code 4014 translates to `_FatalGatewayError`), `_fetch_gateway_url` (appends query, surfaces 429 / missing-URL as errors), `_send_message` (POST shape with `Bot` auth, UTF-16 chunking, 429-then-200 retry-once, 429-then-429 fail-open, 5xx fail-open), `on_send` routing (uses `cmd.channel_id`, falls back to `cmd.user.platform_id`, non-text placeholder, drops on empty channel_id), and end-to-end `_run_session` (sends IDENTIFY when no session vs RESUME when session known, scripted HELLO+READY+MESSAGE_CREATE emits exactly one message event with the correct content shape). Also `cargo test -p librefang-channels -p librefang-types -p librefang-migrate -p librefang-kernel -p librefang-api --features 'librefang-api/all-channels'` runs clean (lib + integration) and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --features 'librefang-api/all-channels' -- -D warnings` is zero-warning.

- **BREAKING: Reddit migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::reddit` adapter (`RedditAdapter`, 903 lines: OAuth2 password-grant token cache + per-subreddit 5 s polling of `GET /r/{sub}/comments?limit=25&sort=new` + `POST /api/comment` reply) is deleted along with the `[channels.reddit]` config schema (`RedditConfig`), the `channel-reddit` cargo feature (incl. its membership in `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email`), the dashboard `ChannelMeta` descriptor + 4 match arms (`is_some` / serialize / `len` / `ser`), the CLI-TUI `ChannelDef`, the kernel `channel_sender` `for_each_channel_field!` entry + `EXPECTED` name-list, and the config-validation env-var hook. `reddit` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` now permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process reddit adapter. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.reddit` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/reddit.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same OAuth2 password-grant token mint with 5 min refresh buffer, same per-subreddit polling at 5 s of `/r/{sub}/comments?limit=25&sort=new`, same `kind == "t1"` filter (posts skipped), same own-/`[deleted]`/`[removed]`-author skip, same `/cmd args` → Command routing, same `POST /api/comment` reply with `api_type=json` and chunks joined by `\n\n---\n\n` (Reddit allows one reply per parent), same dedupe-set cap at 10 000 IDs with oldest-half eviction, same Reddit-required unique `User-Agent` header. **Two improvements on top of the Rust adapter**: (1) **outbound reply target is now correctly wired** — the Rust adapter set `thread_id = subreddit` on inbound and tried to pass `user.platform_id` as the parent fullname to `POST /api/comment`, but `parse_reddit_comment` wrote the author username to `platform_id` (not the fullname Reddit's API needs), so the Rust send-path only ever worked because its unit tests mocked `platform_id = "t1_<id>"` directly — a real bridge call would have 400'd with `thing_id must be a fullname`. The sidecar surfaces the fullname (`t1_<comment_id>`) as `thread_id`, so the daemon round-trips it to `on_send` as `cmd.thread_id` and `_post_comment` uses it directly. This also aligns Reddit's per-comment threading with the Bluesky / Mastodon sidecars (each mention → its own agent session); (2) `suppress_error_responses = true` — Reddit comments are public (same rationale as Mastodon / Bluesky), so internal errors must not echo back as a reply. New env-var knobs: `REDDIT_SUBREDDITS` (comma-separated list of subreddits to monitor, e.g. `rust,programming`), optional `REDDIT_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing, optional `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` to override the default `librefang:sidecar (by /u/librefang-bot)` UA per Reddit's API guidelines. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.reddit]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.reddit` with env vars `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_USERNAME`, `REDDIT_SUBREDDITS` (config table) and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDDIT_PASSWORD` (`~/.librefang/secrets.env`) — see the module's header for the exact config. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest tests/test_reddit_adapter.py` (40 new tests, 212 total) covers env-var enforcement, subreddit normalization (`r/` prefix + trailing-slash stripping), `_split_message` chunking (under-limit, newline-cut, hard-cut), `_parse_reddit_comment` (basic, self-skip case-insensitive, `[deleted]`/`[removed]` skip, empty-body skip, `kind=t3` post skip, `/cmd args` routing, optional permalink omission, malformed input), token fetch (basic-auth header, password-grant form body, 401/missing-field errors, 300 s refresh buffer math), `_verify_credentials` (own_username discovery, 401 rejection), `_post_comment` (basic shape, separator-joined chunks, missing-fullname rejection, 5xx surfaced, 401 → refresh → retry), `_poll_once` (parsed-emit, dedupe on seen IDs, 401 clears token, account_id injection into metadata, per-subreddit transport-error isolation), `_mark_seen` eviction at cap with deterministic list ordering, `on_send` (thread_id → thing_id round-trip, non-text content fallback to placeholder).

- **BREAKING: Gotify migrated from in-process Rust adapter to sidecar-only** — the in-process `librefang-channels::gotify` adapter (`GotifyAdapter`, 649 lines: WebSocket `/stream` subscribe + REST `/message` publish) is deleted along with the `[channels.gotify]` config schema (`GotifyConfig`), the `channel-gotify` cargo feature (incl. its membership in `all-channels` / `all-channels-no-email`), the dashboard channel descriptor + 5 match arms, the CLI-TUI `ChannelDef`, the kernel `channel_sender` registry entry, and the config-validation hook. `gotify` is removed from `crates/librefang-channels/src/channels-allowlist.txt`, so `cargo xtask channel-policy` now permanently rejects any attempt to reintroduce an in-process gotify adapter. Behaviour is preserved by the new reference sidecar `librefang.sidecar.adapters.gotify` (ships in `librefang-sdk`; source at `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/gotify.py`, stdlib-only, on the `librefang.sidecar` SDK): same WebSocket subscribe with token-in-query, JSON frame parsing (`id`/`message`/`title`/`priority`/`appid`), `/`-prefixed-text → `Command`, sender derived from `title` (fallback `app-{appid}`), REST publish with `priority: 5` and chunked title `(i/N)`, optional `GOTIFY_ACCOUNT_ID` for multi-bot routing, exponential-backoff reconnect (1s → 60s). The WebSocket client is a hand-rolled RFC 6455 reader on `socket` + `ssl` (no third-party WS lib) — responds to server pings with masked pongs and echoes close frames before disconnecting. **Operator action required**: an existing `[channels.gotify]` block is no longer recognised — re-declare as a `[[sidecar_channels]]` running `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.gotify` with env vars `GOTIFY_SERVER_URL`, `GOTIFY_APP_TOKEN`, `GOTIFY_CLIENT_TOKEN` (see the module's header for the exact config). The separate gotify *push-notification provider* (`push_provider = "gotify"`, used by device pairing) is unaffected — it is a different feature and was deliberately left intact. Verification: `cd sdk/python && pytest` (97 tests, 22 new for gotify) covers WS frame parsing on a loopback server, schema validation, env-var enforcement, command vs text routing, sender fallback, chunked publish with numbered titles, HTTP error surfacing.

### Fixed

- **Cross-sidecar audit follow-ups: `Retry-After` on 429 for `slack` / `feishu` / `gotify` / `google_chat`; inbound dedupe for `gotify` / `google_chat`; LINE reply-API path now used inside the 55 s freshness window.** Cross-cutting consistency audit across the 27 freshly-migrated sidecar adapters (everything from `ntfy` #5224 through `google_chat` #5459) caught four adapters that landed without 429 handling — Slack's `_post_message` / `_add_reaction` / `_remove_reaction` and Feishu's `_http_json` / Gotify's `_publish` / Google Chat's `_send_text` all routed 429 through the same `status >= 300` arm as 5xx, dropping the chunk and ignoring the `Retry-After` window so the next outbound burst extended the server-side rate-limit. The Slack 3-tuple `_http` helper (`_resp_hdrs` was deliberately stripped) is now a retry-aware wrapper that re-issues the call once with `parse_retry_after(default_secs=RETRY_AFTER_DEFAULT_SECS)` from the shared `librefang.sidecar.common`; `_post_message` / `_add_reaction` / `_remove_reaction` inherit the fix without touching the call sites, so the existing 3-tuple unpack contract is preserved. Feishu's `_http_json` (4-tuple, already exposed headers) gained the same `retry_429=True` once-shot before falling through to its `code != 0` arm. Gotify's `_publish` and Google Chat's `_send_text` factored their POST body into a `_publish_chunk` / `_send_chunk` helper so the 429 retry shares one code path with the original raise-on-non-2xx semantics. Also caught two adapters with missing inbound dedupe — Gotify's WebSocket can replay buffered frames on reconnect and Google Chat's webhook is at-least-once-delivery from Pub/Sub. Both now thread inbound messages through `librefang.sidecar.common.SeenSet` (10 000 / evict 5 000, identical policy to nextcloud / reddit / rocketchat / webex) keyed on `gotify-<id>` and the Google Chat `message.name`. Feishu was a false-positive in the audit — it already has Rust-parity `_EventDedup` (mirrors `feishu.rs:122-125`) used at `_dispatch_event` line 1485. LINE picked up an additional capability fix: the inbound `reply_token` was parsed and stashed in `metadata.reply_token` but `metadata` doesn't round-trip back to the sidecar's `on_send`, so every reply degraded to the push API (quota-charged, rate-limited) even within the LINE-server's ~60 s reply window where the free reply API was available. The token is now carried through `librefang_user` (the field the daemon's bridge round-trips bytewise) with a `linereply:<token>:<event_ts_ms>` shape; a `LINE_REPLY_TOKEN_TTL_SECS = 55.0` window plus a `linereply:` prefix guard (librefang_user is shared across channels — dingtalk stores a sessionWebhook URL, telegram stores an @username — and a misrouted value must not be fed to LINE's reply endpoint) decides between reply and push at send time, with automatic push-fallback if LINE rejects the reply call (the most common case being a token already burned between dispatch and the agent's wakeup). Image+caption sends stay on push regardless (the reply token is one-shot-locked on first acceptance and a follow-up caption would error). Verification: 17 new pytest cases (3 × slack-429 + 3 × feishu-429 + 3 × gotify-429-and-dedupe + 3 × google-chat-429-and-dedupe + 5 × line-reply) across `sdk/python/tests/test_{slack,feishu,gotify,google_chat,line}_adapter.py`; full `pytest tests/` — 1845 passed (was 1828). `cargo check --workspace --lib` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean. **Audited but not changed (false-positives or out-of-scope)**: `feishu` already had Rust-parity dedup via `_EventDedup`; `runtime.py:246` bare-except on `on_command` is OPEN PR #5450 territory (not duplicated here to avoid conflict); `runtime.py:219` producer bare-except is the same class but would conflict with #5450 in the same file — deferred to land after #5450 merges; `mastodon` SSE+poll dual-flow dedupe is theoretical (since_id watermark already covers normal operation); long-lived SSE timeouts are by design. (@houko)
- **`librefang-api` test build repaired after #5455 (webhook → sidecar).** #5455 folded `write_service_account_env` into the generic `write_secret_env` (identical newline-rejection contract) but left `routes/skills.rs`'s unit test calling the removed name, so the `librefang-api` test target failed to compile (`E0425`) and `main` was red again immediately after #5456. The test now calls `write_secret_env` (renamed `write_secret_env_value_with_newline_is_rejected`); same assertions. (@houko)
- **CI on `main` restored — build break + `librefang-migrate` test drift from the wecom/teams/wechat/feishu/whatsapp sidecar merges.** `main` (HEAD `ff3f673`) did not compile and its migrate tests were red, so every open PR's Rust CI was failing on inherited breakage. Compile fixes: (1) `librefang-types` referenced `default_local_probe_interval_secs` from `local_probe_interval_secs`'s `#[serde(default)]` and the `Default` impl but the function was never defined (`E0425`) — added it returning 60 s per the field doc; (2) removed the orphaned `default_channel_max_backoff_secs` / `default_channel_initial_backoff_2s` (no `serde(default=)` consumers, `dead_code` under `-D warnings`); (3) `librefang-migrate::openclaw` — renamed the now-unused `ch` YAML-parse binding to `_ch` (every channel arm is a sidecar skip; the parse only keeps `LegacyYamlChannelConfig` referenced) and removed the orphaned `allow_from_to_toml_array`; (4) `librefang-api::openapi` — dropped the utoipa `paths(...)` refs to the removed `whatsapp_qr_*` / `wechat_qr_*` routes (`E0433`); (5) `librefang-cli` — removed the orphaned `maybe_write_channel_config` / `notify_daemon_restart` helpers (their in-process channel-onboarding callers were dropped). Test-fixture drift (only `google_chat` / `webhook` remain in-process channels): `test_roundtrip_migrate_output_into_real_structs`, `test_json5_channel_extraction`, and `test_full_migration` now use `google_chat` as the in-process witness instead of WhatsApp (asserting WhatsApp as a skipped sidecar); `test_json5_full_migration` / `test_secrets_migration` lower the secret-count floors `7 → 5` and flip the stale `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` extraction assertion to *absent* (the feishu sidecar-skip no longer extracts its secret — note Mattermost still does on skip, an intentional per-channel asymmetry flagged in-test); and the `openfang` `deny_unknown_fields` drift test drops the removed flat `command` field from its `[[mcp_servers]]` fixture so the intended `nickname` typo is what gets rejected. Verified locally: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean, `cargo test -p librefang-migrate` 56 passed, `cargo test -p librefang-memory` 246 passed. (@houko)
- **Telegram sidecar reconnect loop: cap aligned with siblings, recovery now logged, regression coverage added** (closes #5111). #5111 was filed against `v2026.5.12-beta.11`, when telegram was the in-process Rust `librefang-channels::telegram` adapter — that adapter exited its polling task on a DNS resolution / transient network failure and the bridge stayed dead until the daemon was restarted, exactly as the issue describes. The #5241 sidecar migration replaced it with the Python `sdk/python/librefang/sidecar/adapters/telegram.py`, which already wraps `_poll_once` in a `while True / except Exception → backoff` loop and so silently fixes the reported "bridge stays dead" symptom. **This PR is not the bug fix** (that was #5241); it is the observability + cap-alignment + regression coverage that should have shipped alongside #5241 so a future refactor can't re-introduce the original failure mode invisibly: (1) backoff cap moved from a hardcoded `120.0` to a new `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS = 60.0` module constant, matching the convention every sibling polling sidecar (`bluesky`, `discord`, `line`, `mastodon`, `mattermost`, `nextcloud`, `ntfy`, `reddit`, `rocketchat`, `twitch`) already settled on — behavioural change, persistent-outage retries now cap at one-minute intervals instead of two-minute ones; (2) the WARN line on each backoff now reports `retries=<consecutive-failure-count>` alongside `error` and `delay`, so operators can read "how long have we been degraded" off a single log line; (3) on the first successful poll after at least one retry the loop emits an INFO `telegram poll recovered retries=N last_backoff=…` — closes the issue's "restored DNS — bridge does NOT recover" symptom not by changing recovery (it already worked) but by making the recovery visible in the operator's log timeline; (4) `TimeoutError` (LONGPOLL_SERVER_SECS server-side block expiring with no updates — normal protocol behaviour) explicitly resets both `backoff` and `retries_in_a_row` and `continue`s without consuming the sleep budget, so an idle channel never accidentally drifts toward MAX. **Deliberately NOT done** per a deviation from the issue's suggestion of "ERROR only after N consecutive failures": every sibling polling sidecar reserves `log.error` for fatal startup-config issues (`{discord,line,mattermost}_required env vars missing`) — none of them escalate during steady-state backoff. The producer-crash path in `librefang.sidecar.runtime` already emits `log.error("producer crashed", …)` if an exception ESCAPES `produce()`; the backoff loop is precisely the layer that prevents that escape. Adding ERROR escalation here in telegram alone would diverge from the family, and the new WARN-with-retry-counter + INFO-on-recovery already provide the "how long degraded / when restored" signals an operator needs. Three new pytest cases assert the contract end-to-end: `test_produce_recovers_after_startup_network_failure` (URLError on first poll → warn + sleep + retry → success + INFO recovered), `test_produce_backoff_is_capped_at_max` (consecutive failures produce delays = `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 60, 60, …]`, max never exceeds `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`, the cap is actually reached), `test_produce_treats_longpoll_timeout_as_normal` (TimeoutError alternating with success → loop re-enters without sleeping, no backoff growth). All three monkeypatch `tg.asyncio.sleep` against a saved real-sleep closure to avoid the infinite-recursion footgun (`tg.asyncio` and the test file's `asyncio` import point at the same module object). (@houko)
- **CI on `main` restored (post-mattermost-sidecar) — `librefang-migrate::openclaw::tests` test-fixture drift after #5315** (closes #5316). The mattermost sidecar migration converted `mattermost` from in-process to sidecar in the production code paths (both YAML `parse_legacy_channels` and JSON5 `migrate_channels_from_json` now push a `SkippedItem` with a sidecar reason instead of emitting `[channels.mattermost]`), but four `openclaw::tests` cases were not updated in lock-step and used `mattermost` as their only in-process channel witness — so on main the `migrate_channels_from_json` return became `None`, no `ItemKind::Channel` ever landed in `report.imported`, and the JSON5 full-migration imported-count dropped from 7 to 6: (1) `create_legacy_yaml_workspace` only emitted `messaging/{telegram,discord,slack,mattermost}.yaml` — all four now sidecar-skipped — so `test_full_migration` 's `report.imported.iter().any(|i| i.kind == ItemKind::Channel)` asserted against an empty channel-imports vector and panicked at `openclaw.rs:4526`; fixture now also writes `messaging/whatsapp.yaml` (in-process), `test_scan_workspace` 's `channels.len() == 4` updated to `5` with a `whatsapp` membership assert. (2) `test_json5_channel_extraction` 's inline JSON5 (telegram/discord/slack/mattermost-only) made `channels.is_some()` false at `openclaw.rs:4054`; fixture now includes `whatsapp: { dmPolicy: "open", allowFrom: ["phone1"] }`, the `!ch_table.contains_key` / `report.skipped` checks add `mattermost`, the in-process-witness assertion flips from `mattermost` to `whatsapp`, the imported-count stays at 1, the 5-secrets assertion is preserved (mattermost token still flows into `MATTERMOST_TOKEN` via the sidecar-skipped path at `openclaw.rs:1920`), and a `MATTERMOST_TOKEN=mm-token` secrets.env assertion is added so the secret-extraction-on-sidecar-skip behaviour is explicitly covered. (3) `test_json5_full_migration` 's `channel_items.len() == 7` failed; assertion updated to `5` after the rebase (signal also migrated to sidecar in #5317, so the in-process count is whatsapp, matrix, feishu, google_chat, msteams = 5) and the count-comment rewritten to enumerate the 8 skips (telegram, discord, slack, signal, irc, mattermost, imessage, bluebubbles). (4) `test_policy_migration` used `mattermost` for the `dmPolicy: "disabled"` → `dm_policy = "ignore"` happy-path mapping; replaced with `matrix` (still in-process, also accepts `dm_policy`), `mattermost` + `signal` added to the sidecar-skip loop alongside discord/slack, and the comment chain is updated to record the witness-rotation history (discord → slack → mattermost → signal → matrix). All 36 `openclaw::tests` + 51 `librefang-migrate` lib tests + 6 `tests/idempotency.rs` integration tests + `cargo clippy -p librefang-migrate --all-targets -- -D warnings` are green locally. (@houko)
- **Slack sidecar: reply threading + `:eyes:`→`:white_check_mark:` reaction targeting.** `parse_slack_event` set `thread_id = thread_ts` only, so a top-level message carried `thread_id = None`: (a) the bot's reply posted at the channel root instead of threading under the triggering message (the `force_flat_replies` knob exists precisely to opt *out* of threading, so threaded-by-default is the intended behaviour), and (b) `on_send`'s reaction finalization received `None` (always, and doubly so under `SLACK_FORCE_FLAT_REPLIES`) and fell back to "first pending reaction in the channel", so concurrent messages flipped the `:eyes:` on the wrong message and left the real request stuck. `thread_id` now falls back to the message's own `ts` (mirroring rocketchat / nextcloud's `thread_id = parent or own_id`), and `on_send` finalizes against the inbound thread id rather than the force-flattened posting `thread_ts`, so the reaction lands on the exact triggering message. In-thread replies remain best-effort (the `Send` protocol carries no inbound `message_id`). Tests: `test_parse_event_top_level_thread_id_falls_back_to_ts`, `test_on_send_force_flat_finalizes_correct_message`. (@houko)
- **`channel_send` mirror (#4824) restored for sidecar channels** — `resolve_channel_owner` in `crates/librefang-kernel/src/kernel/handles/channel_sender.rs` only scanned the in-process `cfg.channels` (via `for_each_channel_field!`), so once a channel moved to a sidecar (`[[sidecar_channels]]`) it returned `None` and the agent's outbound `channel_send` was no longer mirrored back into the channel-owning agent's session. This silently affected every migrated sidecar channel (telegram #5241, discord #5299, nextcloud, rocketchat, reddit, bluesky, mastodon, and now slack). The resolver now also consults `cfg.sidecar_channels[*].default_agent` (the same field that seeds inbound routing via `AgentRouter.channel_defaults`), keyed by `channel_type` falling back to `name`, so the mirror works uniformly across in-process and sidecar channels. Unit tests: `sidecar_default_agent_matches_by_channel_type_then_name`, `sidecar_default_agent_skips_entries_without_agent_and_is_first_match`. (@houko)
- **CI on `main` restored** — three regressions had main red since #3576: (1) `cargo fmt` drift across `librefang-cli`, `librefang-kernel`, and `librefang-api` workflow operator tests; (2) `test_mcp_http_rehydrates_caller_context_from_agent_header` panicking on the substring assertion because #3576 routed the no-`X-LibreFang-Agent-Id` path through `ToolError::Internal("caller agent id missing — dispatcher did not attribute …")` — but the MCP HTTP route legitimately allows that None path for external clients, so the user-recoverable mapping is `ToolError::MissingParameter("agent_id")` (lifts to `LibreFangError::InvalidInput` → HTTP 400, not `Internal` → 500). The operator-facing per-tool diagnostic is preserved via a `tracing::warn!` next to the constructor. The `cron.rs` unit test was updated in lock-step; the `error-contracts.md` migration note was corrected; (3) `xtask/baselines/openapi.sha256` was stale after a recent `openapi.json` regen — re-baselined via `cargo xtask schema-check gen`. No source-of-truth `openapi.json` / `sdk/` bytes changed; only the schema digest. (@houko)
- **Sidecar polling adapters honour `Retry-After` on 429** (follow-up to #5301, then expanded to cover sibling adapters discovered to share the same gap) — the freshly-migrated `librefang.sidecar.adapters.nextcloud`, `bluesky`, `mastodon`, `rocketchat`, and `ntfy` all shipped with the same defect: the generic exponential-backoff loop (1 s → 60 s, or 1 s → 120 s for ntfy SSE reconnect) ignored `Retry-After`, so when the upstream returned 429 (Nextcloud OCS bruteforce throttle, Bluesky / Mastodon / Rocket.Chat REST rate limit, or ntfy per-topic publish quota) the producer thread / publish loop kept probing inside the server-side block window and extended the throttling. Each adapter now (a) threads response headers through its HTTP helper(s) (`_http` / `_post_json` / `_get_json` / inlined `urlopen` paths) with lowercase-normalised keys, (b) adds a `_retry_after_secs(headers)` static helper that parses seconds-form `Retry-After` with floor 1 s, cap `MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`, and falls back to a per-adapter `RETRY_AFTER_DEFAULT_SECS = 30.0` when the header is absent or unparseable, and (c) detects 429 at every reachable call site — `_verify_credentials`, channel / room discovery, polling, and outbound posting — sleeping the indicated interval and raising so the outer backoff pauses before its next pass (discovery returns empty since the next iteration retries on its own; ntfy SSE subscribe + publish do the same sleep-then-raise as the polling adapters). Verification: 36 new pytest cases across `sdk/python/tests/test_{nextcloud,bluesky,mastodon,rocketchat,ntfy}_adapter.py` — 7 for nextcloud (existing), plus 7 for bluesky, 8 for mastodon (also corrected one pre-existing test that relied on `_FakeUrlopen` returning a 5xx instead of raising `HTTPError`, the real `urlopen` behaviour), 8 for rocketchat, and 6 for ntfy — assert each code path honours the header, falls back when absent, and the existing 471 tests stay green (507 total across the sidecar test suite). Also retroactively documents the silent endpoint bug-fix that landed with #5301: the Rust adapter polled `/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v4/room/<token>/chat` (`crates/librefang-channels/src/nextcloud.rs` lines 273-276 on `89dbd0b5^`), an endpoint the Talk OCS API does not expose for incoming chat — its own `api_send_message` at line 136 already used `/api/v1/chat/<token>`, which is the documented chat endpoint, and which the sidecar uses for both poll and post. Inbound polling on the Rust adapter was likely silently broken (404 / empty body) for any operator using it; the sidecar transparently fixed this on migration. `discord`, `reddit`, and `telegram` were audited and already honoured `Retry-After` (`_parse_retry_after` / `_retry_after_secs` / `_extract_retry_after` helpers respectively); `gotify`, `twitch`, and `webhook` are not applicable (push-only / IRC / inbound-only).

## [2026.5.17] - 2026-05-17

_76 PRs from 5 contributors since v2026.5.12-beta.11._

### Highlights

- **Workflow operator nodes** — Wait, Gate, Transform, Branch, and human-in-the-loop pause/resume steps bring full orchestration control to multi-step workflows, with inline image display and rich invocation support
- **Per-agent compaction & prompt-cache tuning** — agents can now configure context compaction thresholds and Anthropic prompt-cache breakpoint strategy directly in `agent.toml`, reducing token costs on long sessions
- **On-demand tool/skill loading and declarative triggers** — tools and skills load only when needed, and `[[triggers]]` can now be declared directly in `agent.toml`, cutting startup overhead and simplifying agent configuration
- **Async task tracker and training exporters** — a kernel-level async task registry with W&B, Tinker, and Atropos trajectory exporters enables continuous learning pipelines from agent runs
- **Audio transcription and voice routing fixes** — inbound channel audio auto-transcribes when enabled, outbound OGG/Opus correctly routes via `sendVoice`, and per-channel proxy configuration is now supported

## [2026.5.12] - 2026-05-12

_95 PRs from 5 contributors since v2026.5.8-beta.10._

### Highlights

- **Workflow Engine** — agents can now start, cancel, and monitor multi-step workflows natively via new tools (`workflow_start`, `workflow_cancel`, `workflow_list`, `workflow_status`), with run history persisted to SQLite, configurable retry backoff, timeouts, and event triggers that fire workflows directly
- **Multi-Instance Dashboard Management** — manage multiple LibreFang instances from a single dashboard UI
- **Redesigned Memory Page** — the Memory dashboard is rebuilt around a per-agent rail with tabs, and Auto-Dream settings move there from Settings; proactive memory extraction now supports provider-qualified model IDs and per-agent overrides
- **Messaging & Channel Improvements** — full P1 parity for reactions, threads, streaming, redaction, edits, and media; channel messages now mirror into inbound-routing sessions; cron/autonomous fires are labeled with `[Scheduled trigger]` in history
- **Security & Fetch Hardening** — new SSRF-safe `fetch_url_bytes` helper with redirect re-validation, `web_fetch_to_file` for downloading URLs directly to disk, streaming abort on prompt-leak detection, and at-rest token hashing for workflow credentials

- Expose ModelCatalog::from_entries outside cfg(test) — unbreak main (#4798) (@houko)
- Channels bridge: fail closed on non-2xx in `download_file_to_blocks` / `download_image_to_blocks`. Previously a 4xx/5xx response body (e.g. Synapse's 45-byte `M_NOT_FOUND` JSON envelope on the frozen `/_matrix/media/v3/download` endpoint) was streamed to disk as `<uuid>.<ext>` and surfaced to the agent as a corrupt file.
- Matrix adapter: switch inbound media downloads to MSC3916 authenticated `/_matrix/client/v1/media/download/{server}/{mediaId}`, which Synapse 1.100+ requires (default Synapse no longer serves the legacy unauthenticated path). The bot's access token is attached via a new `ChannelAdapter::fetch_headers_for(url)` hook, gated by a homeserver-host match so the credential cannot leak to model-controlled URLs.
- Matrix adapter: flush the placeholder edit on the first non-empty delta instead of waiting for the 1500ms / 256-char debounce. Previously the kernel's `\n\n🔧 toolname\n\n` progress markers were ~35 chars each, so tool-only sequences (rapid tool calls with no LLM prose between them) never crossed the size budget and never re-fired the time check, leaving the user staring at `…` until the agent loop ended. Brings parity with telegram's "first delta becomes the message body" UX.
- Channels bridge: surface the kernel `ToolUseStart` phase as a `LifecycleReaction` to the channel adapter (closes the architectural gap where `librefang-api/src/channel_bridge.rs` filtered every `PhaseChange` event except `context_warning` to `_ => {}`). The streaming dispatch's tee task now sniffs the `\n\n🔧 toolname\n\n` text marker that the api bridge already emits for that phase and fires `send_lifecycle_reaction(... AgentPhase::ToolUse)` so adapters that render reactions (Matrix's redact-previous chain, Slack's reactji) flip the trigger-message reaction to ⚙️ for the duration of the call. The inline text marker is preserved — reactions are an additional surface, not a replacement. Refactor: drain task moved from `tokio::spawn` to a `tokio::join!` sibling so it shares the dispatch task's borrow of `&dyn ChannelAdapter` (avoids the `'static` constraint that would otherwise force an `Arc<dyn ChannelAdapter>` plumbing change).
- Channels bridge: bump `send_lifecycle_reaction` failure logging from `debug!` to `warn!`. The previous level hid per-room rate-limit drops on Matrix (`M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`) where the trailing `✅ Done` reaction was being silently swallowed at default verbosity, making the lifecycle-reaction feature look broken even when it was working. WARN surfaces the actionable diagnosis: "your homeserver is rate-limiting the bot".
- Matrix adapter: tighten streaming edit cadence from 1500ms / 256-char debounce to 700ms / 96-char so progressive deltas remain visible after the first-delta flush. Previous values produced a "placeholder + first + final" cadence on typical 2-3s LLM responses (~150 chars/sec), so the response felt like it arrived in one shot once the placeholder was replaced. New values yield ~4-5 visible edits over the same window — closer to Telegram's 1000ms feel — while still staying inside Synapse's `rc_message: 5/s, burst 60` budget that the operator tuning lifted in this session.
- Matrix adapter: replace the 429-retry string-match (`format!("{e}").contains("429")`) with a typed `MatrixApiError::RateLimited { retry_after_ms }`, and reuse a single `txn_id` across both attempts inside `api_edit_event_with_retry`. The string-match was fragile (any error whose message coincidentally contained "429" would mistrigger); the typed enum is internal-only and erases back into `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>` via `MatrixApiError::into_boxed` so public call sites are unchanged. The txn_id reuse closes an idempotency hole: Matrix dedupes on `(sender, txn_id)`, so a 429 that masks a quietly-successful first PUT would have landed a duplicate `m.replace` event in the room — now the second attempt either hits the same server-side dedup slot or wins fresh. `Retry-After` (delta-seconds form) is honored and clamped to `[100ms, 5s]` so a missing / zero / overlong hint doesn't either spam the homeserver or stall streaming. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Matrix adapter: defensively truncate `api_edit_event` inputs to `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` via `librefang_types::truncate_str` (UTF-8 safe). An edit can only target one event_id so we cannot split into multiple events here — callers that need every byte preserved (streaming overflow) already split BEFORE calling. The cap stops the `send(EditInteractive)` / `send(DeleteMessage)` paths, which today feed `text + button-hint suffix` straight through, from producing an oversized `m.room.message` that Synapse would reject with a hard-to-debug 413 / `M_TOO_LARGE`. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Channels bridge: restore the `send_lifecycle_reaction` rustdoc summary line ("Send a lifecycle reaction (best-effort, non-blocking for supported adapters).") that was accidentally re-attached to `extract_tool_marker_name` during #4831, leaving `send_lifecycle_reaction` summary-less and `extract_tool_marker_name` claiming to "Send a lifecycle reaction…". rustdoc summary indexing now matches the function's actual job. Doc-only — no behaviour change. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Channels bridge: re-converge `download_image_to_blocks` on the shared `http_client::fetch_url_bytes` helper instead of carrying its own SSRF guard + content-length pre-check + chunk-accumulator loop. PR #4831 forked the helper inline because it needed to attach MSC3916 auth headers and the helper didn't yet support them. Now `fetch_url_bytes` / `fetch_url_bytes_unchecked` accept `extra_headers: &[(String, String)]`, so the image path collapses from ~105 LOC back to a single `match`. Telegram's three private-URL multipart-fallback call sites pass `&[]` and behave identically. Adds `fetch_url_bytes_unchecked_attaches_extra_headers` so a future regression that silently drops the headers (e.g. Matrix's Bearer token) fails loud. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Channels: `[channels].file_upload_max_bytes` makes the Matrix and Telegram outbound media upload cap operator-configurable. New `ChannelsConfig.file_upload_max_bytes: u64` field (default 50 MiB to match the previous hardcoded constants; deliberately separate from `file_download_max_bytes` since inbound `server → agent → disk` and outbound `bot → server upload` are different layers, and binding them would let an operator override the inbound knob and silently constrain outbound replies). `MatrixAdapter` and `TelegramAdapter` gain `with_max_upload_bytes(usize)` builders, plumbed in by `start_channel_bridge_with_config` so a single config knob applies to every bot instance. Pinned by `test_with_max_upload_bytes_overrides_default_cap` — a 1 KiB override rejects a 2 KiB upload and the rejection message names the override, so a regression where the builder is silently dropped fails loud rather than re-introducing the hardcoded 50 MiB.

## [2026.5.2] - 2026-05-02

_338 PRs from 7 contributors since v2026.4.28-beta7._

### Highlights

- **iOS & Android mobile app** — native mobile clients launch with responsive UI, bottom-tab navigation, QR-code daemon pairing, and automated TestFlight/Play Store upload
- **FangHub marketplace** — browse, install, and track download/star counts for skills and MCP servers directly from the dashboard, with a redesigned 4-step install wizard
- **Ed25519 peer identity & encrypted OFP connections** — peers now authenticate with persistent Ed25519 keys, TOFU pin storage, and X25519 ephemeral session encryption
- **Redesigned dashboard** — new design-system tokens applied across Overview, Agents, Approvals, Skills, Workflows, and Canvas pages; per-agent stats panel and auto session titles added
- **Broad security hardening** — dozens of fixes covering SSRF, shell injection, auth bypass, TOTP replay, atomic file writes, rate limiting, and sandbox escapes across the daemon and API layer

## [2026.4.28] - 2026-04-28

_67 PRs from 4 contributors since v2026.4.27-beta6._

### Highlights

- **Auxiliary LLM client** — a dedicated cheap-tier model now handles background side tasks, reducing cost on main-agent calls
- **BytePlus, Microsoft (GitHub Models), and Z.ai providers** — three new LLM provider families added, each with their own dedicated API key env vars
- **Thread ownership** — prevents multiple agents from sending duplicate replies to the same thread; paired with a pause/resume foundation for resumable multi-step workflows
- **Redesigned Users surface and dashboard UI** — compact card grid layout, push-style adaptive drawer, unified animations, and richer markdown help drawers across all pages; empty states now land on the marketplace tab automatically
- **Auto-fill channel replies and approval notifications** — channel replies now auto-populate the recipient from the sender, and approval notifications include the agent name for clarity

Per-token siblings (`byteplus`, `volcengine`, `zai`, `zhipu`) keep their original env vars. Set the new env var if you use any `_coding` provider. (#3279) (@houko)
- **BREAKING**: Register `microsoft` (GitHub Models / Azure AI Inference) as an explicit driver-registry entry with its own `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` env var, distinct from `github-copilot`'s `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Same PAT works for both, but the env vars are now separate so configuring one product no longer auto-activates the other in the model picker. Set `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` if you use the `microsoft` provider. (#3281) (@houko)
- **BREAKING**: Split `zai` from sharing `ZHIPU_API_KEY` with `zhipu` — `zai` (api.z.ai) now reads `ZAI_API_KEY` while `zhipu` (open.bigmodel.cn) keeps `ZHIPU_API_KEY`. Same Zhipu credential value works for both, but the env vars are now separate so configuring one no longer auto-activates the other. Set `ZAI_API_KEY` if you use the `zai` provider. (#3285) (@houko)

## [2026.4.18] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Forked agent pattern: kernel exposes `run_forked_agent_streaming(agent_id, prompt, allowed_tools)` for derivative LLM calls that share the parent turn's system + tools + message prefix (Anthropic prompt cache alignment) without persisting the derivative's messages into the canonical session. Anthropic driver's `cache_control` extended from system-only to cover both the last tool block (system + tools prefix) AND the last content block of the last message (full conversation prefix), giving forks near-full cache coverage. Dashboard settings page now surfaces cache-hit rate and per-dream cost so the forkedAgent savings are visible. Proactive-memory `LlmMemoryExtractor` migrated to the forkedAgent pattern: a new trait method `extract_memories_with_agent_id` routes the extraction LLM call through `KernelHandle::run_forked_agent_oneshot` (a new trait method that drives a single-turn fork and returns the final text), sharing the parent agent's `(system + tools + messages)` cache key. The extraction-specific system prompt is embedded into the fork's user message rather than replacing the agent's system prompt, so cache alignment holds. Fall back to a standalone `driver.complete()` with `prompt_caching = true` when no kernel handle is installed (tests / rule-based extractor / fork failure) so system-prompt caching still applies. Kernel wires the extractor's weak handle inside `set_self_handle` — first call only, matching the auto-dream hook idempotency pattern. Migrates auto-dream off its previous `SenderContext { channel: "auto_dream" }` side-channel pattern — dreams now fork from the canonical session and the kernel-side `channel == AUTO_DREAM_CHANNEL` tool filter is replaced by runtime `LoopOptions::allowed_tools` enforcement at tool execute time (request schema stays byte-identical to parent for cache alignment, model's `tool_use` for disallowed tools returns synthetic error). Agent loop adds `LoopOptions { is_fork, allowed_tools }` threaded through; fork turns skip `save_session_async` and add `"is_fork": true` to `AgentLoopEnd` hook context data so subscribers can filter fork events. Auto-dream's own hook filters fork turns to avoid dream-triggers-dream recursion. (@houko)
- Auto-dream: per-agent background memory consolidation with four-layer gating (global / per-agent opt-in / time / session count / file lock). Triggered event-driven from the `AgentLoopEnd` hook (fires the moment an agent finishes a turn) with a sparse daily backstop scheduler for opted-in agents that never turn. Includes web dashboard toggle card, TUI Dashboard strip, `[auto_dream]` config section, `DreamConsolidation` audit events with token and cost capture, runtime tool allowlist enforcement, and `GET/POST/PUT /api/auto-dream/status|trigger|abort|enabled` endpoints.
