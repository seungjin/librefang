# Changelog

All notable changes to LibreFang will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) (YYYY.M.DD).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Stop the release pipeline from generating a stable `librefang` formula in `librefang/homebrew-tap`: the stable CLI now ships from homebrew-core (Homebrew/homebrew-core#290413), so the tap keeping its own copy shadowed the core formula and duplicated maintenance on every release; a stable tag now cascades the newest build into the `beta` / `rc` tap channels only, the keg-only `librefang@<ver>` versioned formula and the desktop cask sync are unaffected, and the release-notes install block now installs the stable CLI directly from core (#6416) (@houko)

### Fixed

- Seed test-booted kernels from a pinned in-repo registry snapshot (`crates/librefang-runtime/tests/fixtures/registry/`, librefang-registry@89d0e4c8) instead of the network: #6410's `LIBREFANG_REGISTRY_OFFLINE=1` export made `sync_registry` a no-op on fresh test homes, turning main red with ~111 registry-content unit tests (model catalog, hand routing, hands registry, MCP catalog/installer, hand activation, metering) plus 3 `librefang-api` integration tests; a new `registry_sync::seed_registry_fixture_for_tests` copies the fixture into the test home and fans it out through the real sync path, `resolve_home_dir_for_tests` and the 27 API-test harnesses use it, `MockKernelBuilder` gains an opt-in `.with_registry_fixture()`, and the env-var test locks are promoted to a crate-wide `test_env::ENV_LOCK` so `tts::test_synthesize_no_provider` no longer races `model_catalog`'s `GOOGLE_API_KEY` setter under threaded `cargo test` (#6421) (@houko)
- Clear the Rust 1.97.0 stable clippy errors (`question_mark`, `useless_borrows_in_formatting`, `for_kv_map`) that turned `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` into a hard failure on the Quality lane of every PR touching a Rust crate — `main` itself stayed green only because its recent commits were docs-only, so CI's per-crate change-detection skipped the Rust lane and never exercised the lint — across `librefang-skills` (`config_injection.rs`), `librefang-runtime` (`a2a.rs`), `librefang-kernel` (`tools_and_skills.rs`), and four `librefang-api` sites (`channel_bridge.rs`, `routes/agents/sessions.rs`, `routes/workflows/workflow.rs`, `tests/totp_flow_test.rs`); folded into this PR because its own Quality lane cannot go green until the lints are fixed, and the registry fixture this PR adds is what keeps the test lanes green alongside the clippy fix (#6421) (@houko)
- Uppercase the character after each separator when deriving the version-pinned Homebrew tap formula's class name, matching Homebrew's `Formulary.class_s`, so a pre-release tag yields `class LibrefangAT2026710Beta1` — the exact casing the `golden_gate` audit requires; #6416's `tr -cd '[:alnum:]'` removed the hyphen but left the channel word lowercase (`...beta1`), which `golden_gate` still rejects, so the next `-beta` / `-rc` release would have generated a versioned formula that fails `brew readall` / install (verified by running the real generation step for a stable and a beta tag → `brew readall` reports zero errors) (#6418) (@houko)
- Generate valid Ruby class names for the version-pinned Homebrew tap formulae (`librefang@<ver>`): the release pipeline stripped only `.` from the version (`tr -d '.'`), leaving the `-` in pre-release versions so `librefang@2026.6.29-beta.14` produced `class LibrefangAT2026629-beta14 < Formula` — a syntax error that made every beta/rc pin fail `brew readall` / install; it now derives the class name with Homebrew's own `Formulary.class_s` rules (`LibrefangAT2026629Beta14`), and the 40 already-published broken pins are corrected in `librefang/homebrew-tap` (#6416) (@houko)
- Emit a single `conflicts_with` cask stanza in the Homebrew tap cask generator (`release.yml` and `release-desktop.yml`): casks allow only one `conflicts_with`, but the generator wrote one stanza per other channel, so `librefang-beta` / `librefang-rc` casks were rejected as invalid; the other channels are now collected into a single array literal (`conflicts_with cask: ["librefang", "librefang-rc"]`), with the two already-published casks fixed in `librefang/homebrew-tap` (#6416) (@houko)
- Export `LIBREFANG_REGISTRY_OFFLINE=1` in the four CI test lanes (unit, Ubuntu shards, Windows, macOS) so test-booted kernels stop fetching the content registry: each fresh temp home triggered a real git clone per boot, and whether the fetch succeeded changed test outcomes — a registry-pre-installed `assistant` `agent.toml` made restore treat the disk template as authoritative and clobber explicit DB model config, deterministically failing PR #6384's restart test in CI while passing locally under `just test` (#6410) (@houko)
- Request extended thinking through the OpenAI-compatible driver: a configured `CompletionRequest.thinking` budget now emits the OpenAI-style `reasoning_effort` parameter (`low` ≤ 4096 tokens, `medium` ≤ 16384, `high` above; budgets under 1024 stay off, matching the anthropic driver's gate), closing the asymmetry where the stream path parsed `reasoning_content` deltas but the request side never asked for them — emitted only under the default echo policy (Kimi's `EmptyString` disable and the DeepSeek `Strip` / `Echo` families are excluded), an explicit `extra_body.reasoning_effort` override takes precedence, and the global `[thinking]` backfill now skips models the catalog marks `supports_thinking = false` so a mixed fleet does not start sending the parameter to known non-reasoning models (#6407) (@houko)
- Correct the channel docs' claim that all five sidecars read `*_DM_POLICY` / `*_GROUP_POLICY` env vars: only the WhatsApp sidecar reads `WHATSAPP_DM_POLICY` (Cloud API webhook mode only; `WHATSAPP_GROUP_POLICY` is read but inert), the Telegram / Discord / Slack / Teams sidecars read neither, and the working migration target is `agent.toml [channel_overrides]` `dm_policy` / `group_policy` enforced by the channel bridge (with `allowed_only` user gating backed by `[[users]]` channel bindings); also replace invalid `dm_policy = "always"` / `group_policy = "trigger_only"` example values that fail manifest deserialization (#6405) (@houko)
- Exempt fresh `read_artifact` results from every re-spill gate — the post-tool chokepoint, the per-result tool budget (Layer 2), and, except as a last resort, the per-turn aggregate budget (Layer 3) — so paging in a spilled tool result larger than `spill_threshold_bytes` returns real bytes (still subject to the pre-existing ~10 KB sanitize truncation cap) instead of minting a fresh artifact stub that again points at `read_artifact`; previously any read in the 16–64 KiB range could never make progress, and a `spill_threshold_bytes` below the sanitize cap recreated the loop at Layer 2 (#6406) (@houko)
- Add a `LIBREFANG_REGISTRY_OFFLINE` switch that skips the registry network refresh (git clone / tarball fallback) while keeping local pre-install copies, and export it from `just test`: every test-booted kernel previously attempted a real registry fetch from its fresh temp home, and the resulting git fork storm exhausted pid limits in constrained containers (`Resource temporarily unavailable` failures in `just test`) (#6408) (@houko)
- Clear the `cargo-deny` / security-audit advisory RUSTSEC-2026-0204 failing CI on every branch by bumping the transitive `crossbeam-epoch` to 0.9.20 (invalid pointer dereference in the `fmt::Pointer` / `fmt::Display` impls for null `Atomic` / `Shared` pointers; pulled in via `rayon-core` → `crossbeam-deque`, lockfile-only change) (#6400) (@houko)
- Surface the model each CLI passthrough provider (`codex-cli`, `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `qwen-code`) is configured to run, read live from the tool's own config, so a custom model — DeepSeek via `~/.codex/config.toml`, a Kimi/Moonshot id via Claude Code's `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `~/.claude/settings.json`, a Gemini preview via `GEMINI_MODEL` / `~/.gemini/settings.json`, or an OpenAI-compatible id via `~/.qwen/settings.json` — is recognised on the Providers page and in the agent model picker instead of only the catalog's default models (#6365) (@houko)
- Stop CLI providers (`codex-cli`, `gemini-cli`, `claude-code`, `qwen-code`) from forcing a placeholder `--model <provider-id>` onto their CLI for a bare provider id, so each CLI defers to its own configured default model (#6365) (@houko)
- Clear `cargo-deny` advisory failures on `main` by bumping `anyhow` to 1.0.103 (RUSTSEC-2026-0190) and ignoring the unmaintained `ttf-parser` advisory (RUSTSEC-2026-0192 — transitive via `pdf-extract` → `lopdf`, no safe upgrade available) (#6366) (@houko)
- Clear the `quick-xml` advisories RUSTSEC-2026-0194 / RUSTSEC-2026-0195 by bumping `plist` to 1.10.0 (pulls the patched `quick-xml` 0.41.0) and `tauri-winrt-notification` to 0.7.3 (drops its `quick-xml` dependency), removing both vulnerable versions from the lockfile (#6387) (@houko)
- Raise the Nix Build job timeout to 120 minutes so the now-routine cold builds — the Rust CI lanes churn the repo's 10 GB Actions cache quota daily, evicting the `/nix/store` cache between runs — complete instead of being cancelled at 60 minutes, unbreaking the workflow that had been red on `main` since June 11 (#6389) (@houko)

## [2026.6.11] - 2026-06-11

_8 PRs from 2 contributors since v2026.6.10-beta.17._

### Added

- **mcp/api: `mcp_runtime_store = "db"` persists `/api/mcp/servers` writes to SQLite instead of `config.toml`, so MCP servers can be managed at runtime when the config file is read-only** (#6113) (@houko).
  #6106 added the DB-backed `mcp_server_configs` store and a boot-time merge, but the API write-path (`POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE /api/mcp/servers`, the taint patch) and the read-path still only saw `config.toml`, so a DB-managed server was invisible to the API and could not be added at all when `config.toml` was a read-only Kubernetes ConfigMap (the #6021 motivation).
  The new `config.toml: mcp_runtime_store` knob (default `file`, byte-for-byte the prior behaviour) routes writes to the store when set to `db`.
  The boot overlay and `reload_mcp_servers` now share one `McpConfigStore::merge_over` helper — previously the hot-reload path dropped DB-backed servers the boot merge had applied — and the handlers read the effective (file + DB) set, so DB-backed servers are listed, fetched, updated, and deleted like file-backed ones and take effect without a restart.
  Tests: `mcp_config_store::tests::merge_over_*` and the `mcp_runtime_store_db_test` API integration suite.

### Fixed

- **llm-drivers(deepseek): recognise `deepseek-v4-pro` as a thinking-with-tools model so its `reasoning_content` is echoed back** (@DaBlitzStein).
  `deepseek-v4-pro` was excluded from `is_deepseek_v4_thinking_with_tools` on the #4842 assumption that it "works out-of-the-box", but production multi-turn tool-call conversations on it return `400 "The reasoning_content in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API."` — the same echo requirement as V4 Flash.
  A delegated agent running `deepseek-v4-pro` failed every turn once its history contained a tool-call thinking turn, so `agent_send` / shared-queue tasks to it never executed; a sibling agent on the same model only avoided it by never trimming its history.
  The model is now matched (Flash + Pro) so the `Echo` reasoning-echo policy applies and the thinking text is round-tripped intact. Regression in `test_is_deepseek_v4_thinking_with_tools_matches_v4_flash`.

## [2026.6.10] - 2026-06-10

_78 PRs from 6 contributors since v2026.5.31-beta.16._

### Highlights

- **Parallel tool-call dispatch** — agents can now execute multiple tools concurrently (opt-in via config flag), reducing round-trip latency for multi-tool turns.
- **Remote Hand marketplace installs** — Hands can be installed directly from the remote marketplace without manual packaging.
- **Skill evolution approval gate** — `auto_evolve` updates now flow through an approval step, and a new `evolution_mode` gives you control over how skills self-improve.
- **Shell execution trusted-binary shortcut** — opt into `safe_bins_skip_approval` to skip approval prompts for a strict allowlisted set of shell commands.
- **Security hardening across the board** — fixes for SSRF allowlist gaps (IMDS/CGNAT addresses), TOML/query-string injection in agent manifests, OOM vectors in streamed tool calls and sidecar stderr, DNS-rebinding in WASM `net_fetch`, supply-chain audit bypass in zip installs, and a pre-handshake memory-exhaustion DoS; plus credential-redaction and vault KDF correctness fixes.

### Highlights

- **Channel adapter sidecar migration** — all 27 messaging integrations (Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Teams, and more) are now isolated sidecar processes instead of in-process adapters; 18 unmaintained adapters were removed. Sidecar adapters can be configured directly from the dashboard.
- **Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval step** — agents can now pause and request operator approval mid-run; approvals route back to the originating chat with inline keyboard buttons on supported adapters, and the same tool only prompts once per session.
- **Credential pools** — configure multiple API keys per LLM provider for automatic round-robin rotation and instant failover on rate limits.
- **Schedule tab & budget visibility** — the dashboard now has an editable Schedule tab for managing triggers, cron jobs, and continuous mode; a new per-provider budget caps surface shows spend and limits per provider.
- **Security hardening** — session tokens are now hashed at rest, SSRF validation added to URL inputs, path-traversal guards tightened across asset and file routes, SQL bindings replace string concatenation in session cleanup, and request bodies are size-capped against pre-allocation DoS.

## [2026.5.17] - 2026-05-17

_76 PRs from 5 contributors since v2026.5.12-beta.11._

### Highlights

- **Workflow operator nodes** — Wait, Gate, Transform, Branch, and human-in-the-loop pause/resume steps bring full orchestration control to multi-step workflows, with inline image display and rich invocation support
- **Per-agent compaction & prompt-cache tuning** — agents can now configure context compaction thresholds and Anthropic prompt-cache breakpoint strategy directly in `agent.toml`, reducing token costs on long sessions
- **On-demand tool/skill loading and declarative triggers** — tools and skills load only when needed, and `[[triggers]]` can now be declared directly in `agent.toml`, cutting startup overhead and simplifying agent configuration
- **Async task tracker and training exporters** — a kernel-level async task registry with W&B, Tinker, and Atropos trajectory exporters enables continuous learning pipelines from agent runs
- **Audio transcription and voice routing fixes** — inbound channel audio auto-transcribes when enabled, outbound OGG/Opus correctly routes via `sendVoice`, and per-channel proxy configuration is now supported

## [2026.5.12] - 2026-05-12

_95 PRs from 5 contributors since v2026.5.8-beta.10._

### Highlights

- **Workflow Engine** — agents can now start, cancel, and monitor multi-step workflows natively via new tools (`workflow_start`, `workflow_cancel`, `workflow_list`, `workflow_status`), with run history persisted to SQLite, configurable retry backoff, timeouts, and event triggers that fire workflows directly
- **Multi-Instance Dashboard Management** — manage multiple LibreFang instances from a single dashboard UI
- **Redesigned Memory Page** — the Memory dashboard is rebuilt around a per-agent rail with tabs, and Auto-Dream settings move there from Settings; proactive memory extraction now supports provider-qualified model IDs and per-agent overrides
- **Messaging & Channel Improvements** — full P1 parity for reactions, threads, streaming, redaction, edits, and media; channel messages now mirror into inbound-routing sessions; cron/autonomous fires are labeled with `[Scheduled trigger]` in history
- **Security & Fetch Hardening** — new SSRF-safe `fetch_url_bytes` helper with redirect re-validation, `web_fetch_to_file` for downloading URLs directly to disk, streaming abort on prompt-leak detection, and at-rest token hashing for workflow credentials

- Expose ModelCatalog::from_entries outside cfg(test) — unbreak main (#4798) (@houko)
- Channels bridge: fail closed on non-2xx in `download_file_to_blocks` / `download_image_to_blocks`. Previously a 4xx/5xx response body (e.g. Synapse's 45-byte `M_NOT_FOUND` JSON envelope on the frozen `/_matrix/media/v3/download` endpoint) was streamed to disk as `<uuid>.<ext>` and surfaced to the agent as a corrupt file.
- Matrix adapter: switch inbound media downloads to MSC3916 authenticated `/_matrix/client/v1/media/download/{server}/{mediaId}`, which Synapse 1.100+ requires (default Synapse no longer serves the legacy unauthenticated path). The bot's access token is attached via a new `ChannelAdapter::fetch_headers_for(url)` hook, gated by a homeserver-host match so the credential cannot leak to model-controlled URLs.
- Matrix adapter: flush the placeholder edit on the first non-empty delta instead of waiting for the 1500ms / 256-char debounce. Previously the kernel's `\n\n🔧 toolname\n\n` progress markers were ~35 chars each, so tool-only sequences (rapid tool calls with no LLM prose between them) never crossed the size budget and never re-fired the time check, leaving the user staring at `…` until the agent loop ended. Brings parity with telegram's "first delta becomes the message body" UX.
- Channels bridge: surface the kernel `ToolUseStart` phase as a `LifecycleReaction` to the channel adapter (closes the architectural gap where `librefang-api/src/channel_bridge.rs` filtered every `PhaseChange` event except `context_warning` to `_ => {}`). The streaming dispatch's tee task now sniffs the `\n\n🔧 toolname\n\n` text marker that the api bridge already emits for that phase and fires `send_lifecycle_reaction(... AgentPhase::ToolUse)` so adapters that render reactions (Matrix's redact-previous chain, Slack's reactji) flip the trigger-message reaction to ⚙️ for the duration of the call. The inline text marker is preserved — reactions are an additional surface, not a replacement. Refactor: drain task moved from `tokio::spawn` to a `tokio::join!` sibling so it shares the dispatch task's borrow of `&dyn ChannelAdapter` (avoids the `'static` constraint that would otherwise force an `Arc<dyn ChannelAdapter>` plumbing change).
- Channels bridge: bump `send_lifecycle_reaction` failure logging from `debug!` to `warn!`. The previous level hid per-room rate-limit drops on Matrix (`M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`) where the trailing `✅ Done` reaction was being silently swallowed at default verbosity, making the lifecycle-reaction feature look broken even when it was working. WARN surfaces the actionable diagnosis: "your homeserver is rate-limiting the bot".
- Matrix adapter: tighten streaming edit cadence from 1500ms / 256-char debounce to 700ms / 96-char so progressive deltas remain visible after the first-delta flush. Previous values produced a "placeholder + first + final" cadence on typical 2-3s LLM responses (~150 chars/sec), so the response felt like it arrived in one shot once the placeholder was replaced. New values yield ~4-5 visible edits over the same window — closer to Telegram's 1000ms feel — while still staying inside Synapse's `rc_message: 5/s, burst 60` budget that the operator tuning lifted in this session.
- Matrix adapter: replace the 429-retry string-match (`format!("{e}").contains("429")`) with a typed `MatrixApiError::RateLimited { retry_after_ms }`, and reuse a single `txn_id` across both attempts inside `api_edit_event_with_retry`. The string-match was fragile (any error whose message coincidentally contained "429" would mistrigger); the typed enum is internal-only and erases back into `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>` via `MatrixApiError::into_boxed` so public call sites are unchanged. The txn_id reuse closes an idempotency hole: Matrix dedupes on `(sender, txn_id)`, so a 429 that masks a quietly-successful first PUT would have landed a duplicate `m.replace` event in the room — now the second attempt either hits the same server-side dedup slot or wins fresh. `Retry-After` (delta-seconds form) is honored and clamped to `[100ms, 5s]` so a missing / zero / overlong hint doesn't either spam the homeserver or stall streaming. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Matrix adapter: defensively truncate `api_edit_event` inputs to `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` via `librefang_types::truncate_str` (UTF-8 safe). An edit can only target one event_id so we cannot split into multiple events here — callers that need every byte preserved (streaming overflow) already split BEFORE calling. The cap stops the `send(EditInteractive)` / `send(DeleteMessage)` paths, which today feed `text + button-hint suffix` straight through, from producing an oversized `m.room.message` that Synapse would reject with a hard-to-debug 413 / `M_TOO_LARGE`. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Channels bridge: restore the `send_lifecycle_reaction` rustdoc summary line ("Send a lifecycle reaction (best-effort, non-blocking for supported adapters).") that was accidentally re-attached to `extract_tool_marker_name` during #4831, leaving `send_lifecycle_reaction` summary-less and `extract_tool_marker_name` claiming to "Send a lifecycle reaction…". rustdoc summary indexing now matches the function's actual job. Doc-only — no behaviour change. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Channels bridge: re-converge `download_image_to_blocks` on the shared `http_client::fetch_url_bytes` helper instead of carrying its own SSRF guard + content-length pre-check + chunk-accumulator loop. PR #4831 forked the helper inline because it needed to attach MSC3916 auth headers and the helper didn't yet support them. Now `fetch_url_bytes` / `fetch_url_bytes_unchecked` accept `extra_headers: &[(String, String)]`, so the image path collapses from ~105 LOC back to a single `match`. Telegram's three private-URL multipart-fallback call sites pass `&[]` and behave identically. Adds `fetch_url_bytes_unchecked_attaches_extra_headers` so a future regression that silently drops the headers (e.g. Matrix's Bearer token) fails loud. (#4831 follow-up) (@houko)
- Channels: `[channels].file_upload_max_bytes` makes the Matrix and Telegram outbound media upload cap operator-configurable. New `ChannelsConfig.file_upload_max_bytes: u64` field (default 50 MiB to match the previous hardcoded constants; deliberately separate from `file_download_max_bytes` since inbound `server → agent → disk` and outbound `bot → server upload` are different layers, and binding them would let an operator override the inbound knob and silently constrain outbound replies). `MatrixAdapter` and `TelegramAdapter` gain `with_max_upload_bytes(usize)` builders, plumbed in by `start_channel_bridge_with_config` so a single config knob applies to every bot instance. Pinned by `test_with_max_upload_bytes_overrides_default_cap` — a 1 KiB override rejects a 2 KiB upload and the rejection message names the override, so a regression where the builder is silently dropped fails loud rather than re-introducing the hardcoded 50 MiB.

## [2026.5.2] - 2026-05-02

_338 PRs from 7 contributors since v2026.4.28-beta7._

### Highlights

- **iOS & Android mobile app** — native mobile clients launch with responsive UI, bottom-tab navigation, QR-code daemon pairing, and automated TestFlight/Play Store upload
- **FangHub marketplace** — browse, install, and track download/star counts for skills and MCP servers directly from the dashboard, with a redesigned 4-step install wizard
- **Ed25519 peer identity & encrypted OFP connections** — peers now authenticate with persistent Ed25519 keys, TOFU pin storage, and X25519 ephemeral session encryption
- **Redesigned dashboard** — new design-system tokens applied across Overview, Agents, Approvals, Skills, Workflows, and Canvas pages; per-agent stats panel and auto session titles added
- **Broad security hardening** — dozens of fixes covering SSRF, shell injection, auth bypass, TOTP replay, atomic file writes, rate limiting, and sandbox escapes across the daemon and API layer

### Security

- **Cross-peer memory leak via non-injective `peer:{pid}:{key}` framing + LLM-controlled `peer:`-prefixed keys** (#5119 + #5120). Two paired confused-deputy holes in the shared-memory substrate are closed at the `KernelHandle::MemoryAccess` boundary. (#5119) `peer_scoped_key` rendered a peer-scoped row as `peer:{peer_id}:{key}` and `memory_list(Some(pid))` recovered the peer's keys via `strip_prefix("peer:{pid}:")`. The pair is only injective when `pid` is non-empty and contains no `:` — a Slack-style `peer_id = "T1:U2"`, an IRC-style `"user:42"`, or an empty `""` (which renders `peer::{key}`, ambiguous with a `None`-scope key literally named `:{key}`) collides with a different `(peer_id, key)` tuple and lets one peer enumerate or shadow another peer's keys. (#5120) `memory_store(key, value, peer_id=None)` accepted any LLM-supplied string for `key`, so an agent running without `peer_id` context could write at `key = "peer:victim:user_name"` in the shared namespace; a subsequent `memory_list(Some("victim"))` recovered the planted row as if `victim` wrote it — a trivial impersonation path that bypasses per-peer isolation entirely. Both vectors are now rejected at the kernel-handle boundary with `KernelOpError::InvalidInput`: `peer_scoped_key` (now `Result`-returning) refuses colon-bearing **and empty** `peer_id` plus `peer:`-prefixed keys; `MemoryAccess::memory_store` / `memory_recall` / `memory_list` enforce the same checks before touching the substrate. On the **read side**, `memory_list(Some(pid))` no longer blindly `strip_prefix`es: each recovered inner key is re-rendered through the now-strict `peer_scoped_key(inner, Some(pid))` and only surfaced when it round-trips byte-for-byte to the stored key, so a pre-fix nested / double-scoped plant (`peer:victim:peer:other:secret`) or any structurally-impossible row is dropped, and a colon-bearing list query is rejected outright before any recovery runs (closing the #5119 cross-peer-strip path for the tool layer). The WAS... (line truncated to 2000 chars) (@houko)

- **MCP transport SSRF guard — replace substring stub with parsed-URL allowlist** (#5124). `McpConnection::check_ssrf` (the gate on the SSE, Streamable-HTTP, and HTTP-compat connect paths in `crates/librefang-runtime-mcp/src/lib.rs`) was a lowercase substring match that rejected only `169.254.169.254` and `metadata.google` — every other internal address bypassed it, including loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`), RFC1918 (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`), AWS IMDS (`metadata.aws.internal`), the NAT64 well-known prefix smuggling IMDS (`[64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe]`), IPv4-mapped IPv6 smuggling loopback (`[::ffff:7f00:1]`), DNS-rebinding hostnames (`169-254-169-254.nip.io`), `user:pw@host` userinfo URLs, and non-`http(s)` schemes like `file://`. A correct policy already existed in the same crate (`mcp_oauth::is_ssrf_blocked_url`); `check_ssrf` is now a thin wrapper around it, so the connect path and the OAuth discovery / token-exchange path share one policy and cannot diverge again. The shared helper also gained `100.64.0.0/10` (CGNAT, incl. Alibaba Cloud IMDS `100.100.100.200`), `metadata.aws.internal`, `instance-data`, `ip6-localhost`, `ip6-loopback`, and an explicit `0.0.0.0` block — aligning the blocklist with `librefang_runtime::web_fetch::check_ssrf`. Tests: the existing `test_ssrf_check` is extended to cover the new categories (loopback IPv4/IPv6/hostname, RFC1918, CGNAT, NAT64-IMDS, IPv4-mapped loopback, userinfo, `file://`, allowed public host). Closes #5124. (@houko)

### Performance

- **Reuse `reqwest::Client` across cron fan-out fires + skip engine on empty targets (#5127)** — `cron_fan_out_targets()` used to call `CronDeliveryEngine::new(sender)` on every AgentTurn / Workflow fire from `cron_tick.rs`, and the engine's constructor in turn built a fresh `reqwest::Client` (TLS context, DNS cache, HTTP/2 connection pool) via `Client::builder().build()`. On busy cron loads (`* * * * *` jobs, `0 */2 * * *` swarms) this churned connection pools per fire even with zero webhook targets configured, FD count climbed under sustained pressure, and TLS handshake CPU rose for no benefit since `reqwest::Client` is documented to be cloned and reused. Two changes: (1) a process-wide `OnceLock<reqwest::Client>` in `kernel::cron_bridge` lazily builds the client on first fan-out and hands a cheap `Arc`-backed `.clone()` to every subsequent `CronDeliveryEngine::with_http_client(sender, http)` invocation, so the TLS / DNS / pool state is reused across all jobs for the lifetime of the daemon; (2) the two call sites in `cron_tick.rs` (`:534` AgentTurn fire, `:638` Workflow fire) now gate the `cron_fan_out_targets` call on `!delivery_targets.is_empty()`, so a job with zero fan-out targets never allocates the bridge `Arc`, never touches the `OnceLock`, and never enters the engine — saving the function-call overhead and the `Arc::clone` of the kernel handle on the common no-webhook path. The DI shape at the engine boundary stays — `CronDeliveryEngine::with_http_client` already existed for tests; the production code now uses it too instead of `new()`. While threading the shared client through, the builder was also routed via `librefang_runtime::http_client::proxied_client_builder()` instead of bare `reqwest::Client::builder()` so the fan-out path picks up the daemon's `[proxy]` config (HTTPS_PROXY / HTTP_PROXY / NO_PROXY), the bundled `webpki-roots` TLS fallback (required on minimal Docker / Termux / musl images that lack a system CA bundle), and the project-wide `libref... (line truncated to 2000 chars) (@houko)

### Fixed

- **Workflow stale-run recovery survives backwards NTP step (#5114)** — `WorkflowEngine::recover_stale_running_runs` previously computed run age as `Utc::now().signed_duration_since(run.started_at)`. Wall-clock arithmetic across daemon restarts is unsound: a backwards NTP correction makes `age` negative so `age < stale_secs` is always true and no row is reaped (silently masking real stale rows); a forward step at boot makes every Running row look ancient and force-fails them all as `Interrupted by daemon restart`. The boot sweep now detects a negative `age`, emits a structured `warn!` with `now`, `started_at`, `run_id`, and the negative `age_secs`, and skips the row (treats it as fresh) without changing state. The proper long-term fix is a monotonic / heartbeat-based reap signal that does not depend on wall-clock; that's out of scope here. Tests: 2 new kernel-unit cases in `librefang_kernel::workflow::tests` — `recover_stale_skips_run_with_started_at_in_the_future` (future `started_at` → row stays Running, empty recovered list, no error/completed_at mutation) and `recover_stale_still_reaps_normally_aged_running_run` (1h-old `started_at` under a 60s cutoff still demotes to Failed, pinning the happy path so the new branch can't silently short-circuit it). (@houko)
- **Cron schedule wedge — validate expression at insert and auto-disable after repeated fallbacks (#5113)** — semantically impossible 5-field cron expressions like `"0 0 30 2 *"` (Feb 30 — never matches) used to pass the librefang-types `validate_cron_expr` field/character check and reach the kernel scheduler, where `compute_next_run_after` silently fell back to `after + Duration::hours(1)` on every `due_jobs()` tick. The job stayed enabled and re-fired hourly for the daemon's lifetime, burning LLM tokens / budget on a schedule that could never produce a real next fire. `CronScheduler::add_job` now probes any `CronSchedule::Cron { .. }` once at insert via the new `compute_next_run_after_opt` helper and rejects with `LibreFangError::InvalidInput` when no future fire exists, before the bad job ever lands in the scheduler. As defense-in-depth for jobs that became unfireable AFTER insert (older persisted jobs, future code paths that mutate schedule without re-validating), a new `JobMeta.consecutive_fallbacks` counter mirrors the existing `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS = 5` shape from `record_failure`: each `due_jobs()` tick that gets `None` from `compute_next_run_after_opt` increments the counter, and on reaching 5 the job is auto-disabled with `auto_disabled = true` and `last_status = "auto-disabled: cron schedule produces no future fire time"` so `reassign_agent_jobs` can still re-enable on agent respawn the same way it does for repeated-failure auto-disables today. The counter resets on `record_success`, explicit `set_enabled(true)`, `update_job` enable-toggle, `reassign_agent_jobs`. Tests: 3 new `librefang-kernel::cron::tests` cases (`test_add_job_rejects_cron_with_no_future_fire` for the Feb 30 case, `test_add_job_rejects_malformed_cron_expression` for the 4-field malformed case pinning the librefang-types layer from the scheduler side, `test_due_jobs_auto_disables_after_repeated_fallbacks` driving 5 ticks against an injected wedged schedule and asserting `enabled = false` + `auto_disabled = true` + counter = 5 + subsequent ticks don't return it). Closes #5113. (@houko)

- **Trigger cooldown wedges when `last_fired_at > now`** (#5115). The cooldown check in `librefang_kernel::triggers::TriggerEngine::evaluate_with_resolver` computed `elapsed = (now - last).to_std().unwrap_or(Duration::ZERO)`; on a future-dated `last_fired_at` (wall-clock backstep after NTP correction, manual clock adjustment, VM snapshot restore, or imported state with an ahead-of-now timestamp) `to_std()` errors, the fallback collapses elapsed to 0, and `0 < cooldown` then silently suppresses every gated trigger fire until the wall clock catches up. Replaced with a typed match on the `to_std()` result: the `Err` arm emits a structured `warn!` with `trigger_id`, `agent_id`, `now`, and `last_fired_at`, and treats the cooldown as elapsed-exceeded (`Duration::MAX`) so the trigger fires once. The successful fire then overwrites `last_fired` with `now`, self-healing the registry entry so subsequent evaluations resume the normal cooldown path. Regression test (`test_cooldown_unwedges_on_future_last_fired_at`) seeds the registry with a `+1h` future timestamp, asserts the first evaluation fires, that `last_fired` is rewritten to a non-future value, and that the immediate second evaluation is suppressed by the normal cooldown again — pinning both the unwedge and the self-heal. Closes #5115. (@houko)

- **API request DTOs reject unknown fields so body typos surface as 400 instead of silent feature loss (#5131)** — Every `*Request` / `*Body` shape that an axum `Json<T>` extractor materialises in `crates/librefang-api/src/` gains `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`. Before the fix, a payload like `{"name":"x","url":"…","evnts":["foo"]}` (note the typo'd `evnts`) deserialised to `CreateWebhookRequest` with the unknown key silently dropped and `events` defaulting to `[]`; the server returned 201 Created and the webhook never fired anything. After the fix, serde rejects the payload at the deserialization boundary and axum surfaces 400 Bad Request — the operator sees the typo immediately. DTOs locked down: `webhook_store::{CreateWebhookRequest, UpdateWebhookRequest}`; `types::{SpawnRequest, MessageRequest, AttachmentRef, InjectMessageRequest, SkillInstallRequest, SkillUninstallRequest, SetModeRequest, MigrateRequest, MigrateScanRequest, ClawHubInstallRequest, BulkCreateRequest, BulkAgentIdsRequest, ExtensionInstallRequest, ExtensionUninstallRequest, PushMessageRequest}`; `routes::approvals::{CreateApprovalRequest, ApproveRequestBody, ModifyRequestBody, BatchResolveRequest, ApproveAllForSessionRequest, TotpSetupBody, TotpConfirmBody, TotpRevokeBody}`; `routes::agents::{SetAgentToolsRequest, UpdateIdentityRequest, PatchAgentConfigRequest, CloneAgentRequest, SetAgentFileRequest}`; `routes::users::{UserUpsert, BulkImportRequest}`; `routes::memory::{MemoryAddBody, MemoryUpdateBody}`; `routes::skills::PatchMcpTaintRequest`; `routes::terminal::{CreateWindowRequest, RenameWindowRequest}`; `routes::auto_dream::SetEnabledRequest`; `routes::pairing::PairingCompleteRequest`; `server::ChangePasswordRequest`. Deferred (and why): OpenAI-compat `ChatCompletionRequest` (clients legitimately send `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, `n`, … — OpenAI's own spec is permissive); OAuth `CallbackBody` / `IntrospectRequest` / `RefreshRequest` (RFC 6749 §3.1 / RFC 7662 explicitly permit extra parameters); request DTOs that live in `librefang-types` (`MediaImageRequest`, `MediaTtsRequest`, `MediaVideoRequest`, `MediaMusicRequest`, `PromptVersion`, `PromptExperiment`, webhook `WakePayload` / `AgentHookPayload`) — they are shared types that are also deserialised from internal stores, so locking them down belongs in their owning crate, not this PR. **Potential client breakage**: callers that previously got away with sending extra fields (typos, optimistic forward-compat keys, debug fields) will now get 400 Bad Request on the listed endpoints. This is the intended behaviour — the silent-drop semantics were the bug — but operators with custom integrations should audit their request bodies. Integration test `crates/librefang-api/tests/api_deny_unknown_fields_test.rs` drives the canonical reproduction from the issue (`POST /api/webhooks` with `evnts` typo) and asserts 400 + zero side-effects, plus a companion test that the same handler still accepts a correctly-spelled body. Closes #5131. (@houko)

- **`POST /api/providers/{name}/default` no longer wipes operator-authored sections of `config.toml`** (#5116). `persist_default_model` previously read the existing config with `std::fs::read_to_string(&path).unwrap_or_default()`, so any transient read failure (`EACCES`, `EIO`, …) collapsed the input to an empty string. The rewrite then serialized a fresh TOML tree containing only `[default_model]` through `atomic_write`, atomically replacing the on-disk file and silently destroying every other section the operator had authored (`[email]`, `[telegram]`, `[proxy]`, `[skill_workshop]`, `[queue]`, …). The fix discriminates `ErrorKind::NotFound` (which legitimately means "first write" — the daemon may create `config.toml` here) from every other read error and returns the latter as `Err`, so the route reports a failed `persisted=false` to the caller and leaves the on-disk file untouched rather than truncating it. The downstream `toml::from_str` / `atomic_write` path is unchanged so the existing crash-safety (temp-write + rename) still applies to a successful merge. Integration test: `set_default_provider_preserves_other_config_sections` in `crates/librefang-api/tests/providers_routes_test.rs` pre-seeds `config.toml` with `[default_model]` + sibling `[email]` and `[proxy]` sections, drives the route, and asserts all three survive in the post-write file; `set_default_provider_when_config_toml_absent_creates_it_with_default_model` pins the `NotFound` branch to confirm the fresh-daemon case still writes a usable config. (@houko)

- **`memory::save_session` silently truncated persisted history to 200 messages** (#5121). `MemorySubstrate::save_session` capped the SQLite write at a hard-coded `MAX_PERSISTED_MESSAGES = 200`, but `clamp_max_history` (`librefang-runtime::agent_loop::history`) only enforces a floor — operators configuring `max_history_messages > 200` (long-context Anthropic / Gemini agents) kept N messages in RAM and persisted only 200, silently losing messages `200..N` on every daemon restart with no log to surface the loss. The original cap (#2929) is kept as defense-in-depth against worst-case blob size and cold-reload RAM, but raised to 2000 — comfortably above any realistic in-memory clamp — and now emits a structured `warn!` log with `agent_id`, `session_id`, `requested_count`, and `cap` when truncation actually fires, so operators are no longer blind to the (now-rare) cases where the cap engages. The stale "in-memory limit is much lower" comment is rewritten to accurately describe the relationship between the runtime trim cap and the persistence ceiling. Two regression tests pin the new contract: `test_save_session_preserves_history_above_legacy_cap` persists 300 messages and asserts the oldest survives reload (the old 200 cap would have dropped it), and `test_save_session_truncates_above_defense_in_depth_cap` confirms the cap still fires above 2000 with the correct most-recent window preserved.

- **Docs sync for `DEFAULT_MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES` (60, not 40)** — `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/architecture/message-history-trimming.md` still cited the compiled-in default as 40, but `crates/librefang-runtime/src/agent_loop/history.rs:38` has been 60 since #4891. Pure docs sync; no code or behaviour change. (@houko)

- **Dashboard mutation cache invalidation — budget/usage on send, snapshot prefix on session model override (#5122, #5123)** — two `crates/librefang-api/dashboard/src/lib/mutations/` invalidation bugs that left the UI showing stale data after a successful mutation. (1) `useSendAgentMessage` promised in its JSDoc that the topbar Budget chip and Analytics page would refresh after a completed turn but only invalidated `agentKeys.session / sessions / stats`; neither `budgetKeys` nor `usageKeys` was touched, so spend updates were invisible until the next poll. Imported both factories and added `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: budgetKeys.all })` + `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: usageKeys.all })` to `onSuccess`. (2) `useSetSessionModelOverride` called `agentKeys.session(variables.agentId)` with the `sessionId` argument omitted, which resolves to the 4-element key `["agents","session",agentId,null]` and only invalidates the "no override" snapshot slot — any cached `(agent, sessionId)` snapshot keyed by an explicit `sessionId` stayed stale. Switched to the 3-element prefix `agentKeys.sessionSnapshots(variables.agentId)` so every snapshot for the agent is invalidated regardless of how its sessionId slot was filled. Tests: 2 new cases in `agents.test.tsx` (`useSendAgentMessage` with explicit `session_id` asserts the 4-element `agentKeys.session(agentId, sessionId)` plus `budgetKeys.all` / `usageKeys.all`; without `session_id` asserts the null-slot fallback plus the same budget/usage pair), 2 new cases in `misc-mutations.test.tsx` (`useSetSessionModelOverride` with `agentId` asserts exactly 4 invalidate calls including `agentKeys.sessionSnapshots(agentId)` and explicitly NOT the 4-element `agentKeys.session(agentId)` form; without `agentId` asserts only the two session-keyed invalidates fire). Closes #5122. Closes #5123. (@houko)

- **External hook concurrency cap no longer silently bypassed on `SemaphoreClosed` (#5118)** — `ExternalHookSystem::run_hook` previously acquired its `HOOK_CONCURRENCY` permit with `.acquire().await.ok()`, so a closed semaphore returned `None` and the hook ran anyway, defeating the documented system-wide cap on external hook `fork()` rate. The static `LazyLock<Semaphore>` is never closed in practice, but the silent bypass is exactly the kind of "shouldn't happen so it's fine" assumption that turns into a fork-bomb when something upstream changes. Acquire is now factored into a small `acquire_hook_permit` helper that returns `Option<SemaphorePermit<'_>>`: on `Ok(permit)` the hook runs as before; on `Err(SemaphoreClosed)` the helper logs `error!("HOOK_CONCURRENCY semaphore closed; refusing to run hook", hook_name=…, event=…)` and returns `None`, and `run_hook` early-returns without spawning the process. Refusing the hook makes the cap a hard guarantee instead of a best-effort one. Tests: 2 new `#[tokio::test]` cases in `librefang_kernel::hooks::tests` — `acquire_hook_permit_returns_some_on_open_semaphore` (sanity check that a fresh local `Semaphore::new(1)` still yields a permit) and `acquire_hook_permit_returns_none_when_semaphore_closed` (the regression itself: a closed local `Semaphore` must refuse to run a hook). Refs #5118. (@houko)

- **Strict-mode config preserves nested `serde(alias)` declarations and denies unknown fields inside repeated tables (#5129 + #5130)** — closes two silent failure modes in `librefang-types` config validation. (1) schemars (0.8) drops `#[serde(alias = …)]` annotations when generating the JSON Schema, so the strict-mode allowlist derived in `validation.rs` was missing nested aliases such as `terminal.trust_proxy_headers` (alias for `require_proxy_headers`); under `strict_config = true` a legacy config carrying the old spelling was rejected as "unknown field" and boot fell back to `KernelConfig::default()`, silently dropping the operator's intent. Added a `MANUAL_NESTED_ALIASES` constant (mirroring the existing `MANUAL_TOP_LEVEL_ALIASES`) and spliced its entries into the schema-derived nested allowlist, gated on the parent path actually existing in the schema so stale entries cannot widen the allowlist by accident. (2) `KernelConfig::detect_unknown_nested_fields` only walks single-table paths and cannot descend into elements of repeated tables (`[[channels.telegram]]`, `[[mcp_servers]]`, …), so typos inside those entries deserialised into the element's `Default` and the operator's intent never reached the runtime. Added `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` to `TelegramConfig`, `DiscordConfig`, `SlackConfig`, `WhatsAppConfig`, `MattermostConfig`, and `McpServerConfigEntry` so serde itself rejects unknown keys on every element regardless of repeated-vs-single TOML shape. **Operator-visible breakage**: configs with stray / mistyped keys inside any of these six sections now fail to deserialize with a `unknown field …` error; `kernel::config::load_config` logs the error at `warn` and falls back to a full `KernelConfig::default()` for the whole file (api_listen, channels, providers — everything — reverts to defaults until the typo is fixed). The offending field name is in the warn log so the fix is local. The reload path (`try_load_config`) returns `Err(...)` and refuses to apply the bad config, preserving the live in-memory state. Tests: 4 new unit tests in `crates/librefang-types/src/config/mod.rs` (`strict_config_accepts_nested_serde_alias_5129`, `strict_config_rejects_typo_in_repeated_channel_table_5130`, `strict_config_rejects_typo_in_repeated_mcp_servers_table_5130`, `well_formed_repeated_channel_table_still_parses_5130`). The remaining channel structs (Signal/Matrix/Email/Teams/IRC/Twitch/Rocket.Chat/Zulip/XMPP/LINE/Viber/Messenger/Reddit/Mastodon/Bluesky/Feishu/Revolt/Nextcloud/Guilded/Keybase/Threema/Nostr/Webex/Pumble/Flock/Twist/Mumble/DingTalk/QQ/Discourse/Gitter/ntfy/Gotify/LinkedIn/Webhook/Google Chat) were left tolerant in this PR to keep the operator-visible breakage scoped to the issue's stated targets; locking them down can land as a follow-up once we confirm no in-the-wild configs carry stray fields. (@houko)
- **Workflow operator-node validation + dry-run gaps (#4980 review on #5035)** — closes two silent run-time failure modes the original PR series shipped. (1) `Workflow::validate()` now rejects any workflow that combines `depends_on` with an operator-node `StepMode` (Wait / Gate / Approval / Transform / Branch). The DAG executor (`execute_run_dag`) does not match on `StepMode` and would otherwise route operator nodes through `agent_resolver`, surfacing `format_missing_agent_error` at run time instead of the operator's wait / gate / transform / branch behaviour. Wiring the operators into the DAG executor was rejected in favour of the validate gate because Branch's forward-jump semantics interact non-trivially with DAG layer ordering (`Loop` already covers backward jumps, and a forward jump across parallel layers has no obvious meaning). (2) `WorkflowEngine::dry_run` now emits a `_operator:<kind>` row with `agent_found = true` for each operator-node step instead of falling through to `agent_resolver` and reporting them as broken-agent rows; Transform additionally re-runs `validate_transform_template` and surfaces parse errors as `skipped` with a typed reason matching the run-time executor's shape. Also folded into the same change: nit cleanup from the review — the synthetic `StepResult.prompt` slot now carries a unified JSON-object trace shape (`{"op": "<kind>", ...}`) across Wait / Gate / Transform / Branch so a future dashboard renderer can dispatch on `op` alone, Branch's match-path trace now carries the truncated decision input (operators debugging a "wrong arm fired" report could previously see only the arm index), `prompt_template` on Wait / Gate / Approval / Branch is rejected at validate time when it is anything other than the default (the executor silently ignored it, and `Transform` legitimately uses its own `code` field instead), and the stale `record_operator_noop_step_result` docstring is narrowed to Approval (the only remaining caller after steps 2–4 wired their own inline `StepResult`s). Dashboard editor support for operator nodes — distinct styling, inline config fields — is the remaining piece tracked against #4980 and deferred to a separate PR. Tests: 2 new kernel-unit cases (`workflow_validate_rejects_operator_node_combined_with_dag_depends_on` and `workflow_validate_rejects_non_default_prompt_template_on_operator_nodes`) plus 2 acceptance cases (`workflow_validate_accepts_default_prompt_template_on_operator_nodes`, `workflow_validate_accepts_non_default_prompt_template_on_transform`); 3 new integration cases in `workflow_operator_nodes_test.rs` (`validate_rejects_dag_workflow_with_operator_node_step`, `dry_run_reports_operator_nodes_as_found_with_synthetic_agent_names`, `dry_run_marks_unparseable_transform_template_as_skipped`); the existing `branch_step_arm_hit_routes_to_target_and_skips_intermediate_steps` updated to assert the new JSON trace shape. Refs #4980, #5035. (@houko)

### Added

- **Rich workflow invocation — engine-side per-key `{{var}}` substitution from JSON input** (#4982 follow-up, PR #5075). Closes the BLOCKING gap from #4982 review: the runtime's `_artifact` resolver was already landing the resolved handle string in the workflow input JSON, but `WorkflowEngine::execute_run_sequential` / `execute_run_dag` initialised an empty `variables` map and never extracted per-key vars from the input object, so `{{cover}}` / `{{topic}}` in step prompts stayed literal — defeating the whole "agent passes `{cover: {_artifact: …}}` → step receives the handle as `{{cover}}`" promise. New `seed_input_vars_from_json` helper extracts top-level keys at the dispatch boundary (sequential / DAG / dry-run paths) and feeds them into the substitution map; string values pass through verbatim, numbers / bools `to_string()`, nested objects / arrays serialise as compact JSON. Existing entries (resume-snapshot variables, prior-step `output_var` writes) win over the seed via `entry().or_insert()`. `{{input}}` (the whole-blob form) keeps rendering the original blob for backward compat. Surface adds: `kernel-handle` types `WorkflowSummary`, `WorkflowInputParam`, `WorkflowDescription`, `StepOutputSummary`, `WorkflowRunSummary` gain `#[non_exhaustive]` so the staged #4982 follow-ups (param-type strictness, dashboard hints) stay non-breaking — paired with `new()` constructors that downstream crates use in place of struct literals; `regex::Regex::new` at `workflow_runner.rs::describe_workflow` now caches via `std::sync::OnceLock` instead of recompiling per call, and `expect`s rather than silently returning "workflow not found" on a static-pattern bug; `Invalid '_artifact'` error message now interpolates the offending handle string unconditionally so the agent sees it on every failure path, not only the wrong-length one. Tests: 5 new unit in `librefang_kernel::workflow::tests` (`seed_input_vars_from_json` covers all JSON value kinds, the non-object no-op cases, and the preserve-existing-entries semantics; `execute_run_substitutes_per_key_vars_from_object_input` and `execute_run_dag_substitutes_per_key_vars_from_object_input` pin the sequential + DAG dispatch boundaries by capturing the prompt the agent loop would receive). 3 new integration in `crates/librefang-api/tests/workflows_routes_integration.rs` (POST + GET round-trip of `input_schema` rows, PUT replacement semantics, malformed-row skip-WARN policy). 1 new in `crates/librefang-kernel/tests/workflow_integration_test.rs` (`workflow_engine_substitutes_input_schema_vars_into_step_prompt` — end-to-end claim that a workflow with `[[input_schema]]` declaring `topic: string` + `cover: file`, run with `{"topic":"Rust","cover":"sha256:…"}`, dispatches a step prompt with both placeholders filled). (@houko)

- **Rich workflow invocation from agents — parameter discovery, file/image input refs, structured run results** (#4982). Workflows are already launchable via `workflow_run` / `workflow_start`, and the kernel async task tracker (#4983, PR #5033) covers Gap 1 (non-blocking + auto-notify). This PR fills the remaining two gaps and enriches the result shape. (a) Parameter discovery — `Workflow` gains an optional `input_schema: Vec<WorkflowInputParam>` field (each entry: `name`, `param_type` ∈ `string|number|boolean|file|image|agent_id`, `required` defaults true, `description?`). New `workflow_describe(workflow_id)` tool returns `{id, name, description, step_names, input_schema}`; when no explicit schema is authored, the kernel auto-detects parameters by scanning `{{var}}` placeholders across step `prompt_template`s (reserving `{{input}}` for previous-step output as it does today). `workflow_list` adds `has_input_schema` so the LLM knows when calling `workflow_describe` is worthwhile. (b) File/image input — `workflow_run` / `workflow_start` input now accepts `{"_artifact": "sha256:<64-hex>"}` shapes anywhere in the JSON object; the runtime resolves them to bare handle strings before the workflow engine substitutes them into step prompts, so a downstream step can `read_artifact` the bytes. Handle format is validated upfront via `artifact_store::ArtifactHandle::parse`; a malformed `_artifact` reference fails the tool call with a clear error rather than silently rendering `[object Object]` into a step prompt. (c) Structured results — `workflow_run` / `workflow_status` now return `step_outputs: [{step_name, output}, ...]` alongside the final output string, plus `output_json` when the final-step output parses as JSON; the agent can navigate stage results without re-fetching. Surface: kernel-handle gains `WorkflowRunner::describe_workflow`, `WorkflowInputParam`, `WorkflowDescription`, `StepOutputSummary`; `WorkflowSummary` adds `has_input_schema`; `WorkflowRunSummary` adds `step_outputs`. HTTP `POST/PUT /api/workflows` accept `input_schema` arrays; `GET` renders them. Tests: 14 unit tests in `librefang_runtime::tool_runner::rich_workflow_invocation_tests` (artifact-ref resolution at top-level / nested-in-array / invalid handle / multi-key object guard; `prepare_workflow_input` JSON-shape contract; `build_workflow_run_result` shape with and without parsed output_json / step_outputs; `workflow_describe` tool definition + descriptors), 3 in `librefang_kernel::workflow::tests` (TOML + JSON round-trip of `WorkflowInputParam`, default-required-true behaviour), 3 in `crates/librefang-kernel/tests/workflow_integration_test.rs` (explicit `input_schema` surfaces verbatim via `describe_workflow`; auto-detect fallback skips reserved `{{input}}` and sorts deterministically; `workflow_list.has_input_schema` is true for explicit + auto, false when no placeholders). Closes #4982. (@houko)

- **Async task tracker — review fixes for #5033** (#4983). Dedupe `register_async_task` against existing `(run_id)` / `(target_agent, prompt_hash)` so `workflow_start` can't silently orphan a handle on duplicate registration. Wake-idle now acquires `Lane::Trigger` and the per-agent `max_concurrent_invocations` semaphore before `send_message_full`, so operator-set fan-out caps apply uniformly with trigger dispatch. Boot-time recovery sweep walks the registry for tasks tied to runs demoted by `recover_stale_running_runs` and synthesizes `TaskStatus::Failed("workflow run interrupted by daemon restart")` events. Timeout text format pinned by a string-equality unit test in `kernel/handles/workflow_runner.rs`; renderer-drift test in `async_task_tracker_runtime_test.rs` asserts kernel/runtime renderers produce identical bytes. `KernelApi::injection_senders_ref` and `pending_async_task_count` marked `#[doc(hidden)]` to keep test introspection off the public docs surface. (@houko)
- **Async task tracker — runtime consumer + `[async_tasks]` manifest config (step 3/3)** (#4983). Third and final PR of the kernel-level async task tracker proposed in the issue. Builds on step 2 (#5045) to add the runtime-side wake-idle path, the per-agent `[async_tasks]` config block, and end-to-end integration tests through `TestServer`. New `AsyncTasksConfig` struct in `crates/librefang-types/src/agent.rs` carries `default_timeout_secs: Option<u64>` (None = no kernel-imposed default, matching the step-1 "timeout ownership is agent-side" decision) and `notify_on_timeout: bool` (default `true`); wired onto `AgentManifest.async_tasks` with `#[serde(default)]` so existing `agent.toml` files keep parsing. The corresponding entry in `AgentManifest::Default` is added — `CLAUDE.md` "Common Gotchas" specifically calls out missing `Default` impl entries as a silent build-failure trap (#4870). Step-2 kernel registry methods (`register_async_task`, `complete_async_task`, `pending_async_task_count`) plus a test-only `injection_senders_ref` accessor are surfaced on the `KernelApi` trait so integration tests can drive the tracker through the same trait object the dashboard and route handlers use, instead of needing the concrete `LibreFangKernel`. `complete_async_task` gains a wake-idle code path: when the originating session has no live injection receiver attached (because the agent loop is idle between turns), the kernel upgrades the stored `Weak<LibreFangKernel>`, renders the `TaskCompletionEvent` as the same `[System] [ASYNC_RESULT]` line that the runtime's mid-turn handler produces, and spawns a fresh `tokio::task` that drives a new turn via `send_message_full(agent_id, &rendered_text, …, Some(session_id))` pinned to the originating session. The wake-up is detached so the workflow that called `complete_async_task` returns immediately — agents wake on their own time without backpressuring the executor. The renderer logic is duplicated between `librefang-runtime::agent_loop::format_task_completion_text` (mid-turn) and `librefang-kernel::kernel::task_registry::format_task_completion_text` (wake-idle) because the runtime crate cannot re-export back into the kernel (the runtime depends on `librefang-kernel-handle`, not on the kernel directly); both sites produce byte-identical output by convention so session history reads consistently regardless of delivery path. The async-spawn block in `kernel/handles/workflow_runner.rs::start_workflow_async_tracked` now honours `[async_tasks]` settings: it caches the caller agent's `AsyncTasksConfig` at registration time, wraps `execute_run` in `tokio::time::timeout(Duration::from_secs(default_timeout_secs))` when set, and emits `TaskStatus::Failed("workflow run timed out after Ns (agent-side default_timeout_secs)")` on elapsed timeout. `notify_on_timeout = false` suppresses ONLY the timeout-specific event; success and non-timeout failures still surface as today — operationally meaningful for batch agents whose sessions are never read by a human. 7 new `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` in `crates/librefang-api/tests/async_task_tracker_runtime_test.rs`: `[async_tasks]` block parses out of `agent.toml` (with explicit + missing-block defaults), kernel-handle `register_async_task` + `complete_async_task` round-trip through the `Arc<dyn KernelApi>` exposed on `AppState`, mid-turn delivery to a live receiver, wake-idle spawn when no receiver is attached (the `set_self_handle()` dance that the `boot()` helper performs is documented inline because the wake-idle path silently no-ops without it), `start_workflow_async_tracked` fail-fast on unknown workflow id (the lookup-before-register ordering is operator-visible — pinned by the test so it stays that way), `notify_on_timeout = false` round-trips through agent spawn and lands in the registry verbatim (#4870-style "config field landed in the active state" check), and double-completion via `AppState.kernel.complete_async_task` is a no-op on the second call (only one signal arrives on the channel). 1 additional `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` in the existing kernel-side test file (`wake_idle_path_returns_true_when_self_handle_is_set`) explicitly exercises the spawn-with-self_handle code path the integration test depends on. Verified with `cargo check --workspace --lib`, `cargo clippy -p librefang-kernel --lib -- -D warnings`, `cargo test -p librefang-kernel --test async_task_tracker_test` (8/8 pass, +1 since step 2), `cargo test -p librefang-api --test async_task_tracker_runtime_test` (7/7 pass, new), `cargo test -p librefang-kernel --test workflow_integration_test` (4/4 pass), `cargo test -p librefang-runtime --test tool_runner_workflow_write` (12/12 pass), `cargo test -p librefang-kernel --test kernel_handle_contract_broader` (6/6 pass — confirms the new `KernelApi` methods on `LibreFangKernel` did not break the broader contract). Refs #4983. Refs #5033 (step 1). Refs #5045 (step 2). (@houko)

- **Async task tracker — kernel registry + event injection (step 2/3)** (#4983). Second of three PRs landing the kernel-level async task tracker proposed in the issue. Builds on the types-only step 1 (#5033) to add the kernel-side substrate: a `HashMap<TaskId, PendingTask>` async-task registry under `EventSubsystem`, two inherent `LibreFangKernel` methods (`register_async_task(agent_id, session_id, kind) -> TaskHandle` and `complete_async_task(task_id, status) -> Result<bool, KernelError>`), and a delivery path that wraps the terminal `TaskCompletionEvent` in a new `AgentLoopSignal::TaskCompleted` variant and pushes it through the existing per-`(agent, session)` mid-turn injection channel (#956) — reusing one mechanism instead of building a parallel one. Migrates the kernel's existing `WorkflowRunId` to a `pub use librefang_types::task::WorkflowRunId` re-export so workflow runs and async-task handles share one canonical newtype. `start_workflow_async` now forwards to a new `start_workflow_async_tracked(workflow_id, input, caller_agent_id, caller_session_id)` `KernelHandle` method that registers a `TaskKind::Workflow` entry against the originating session when both pieces of caller context are supplied; on terminal completion of the spawned `execute_run`, the kernel emits a `TaskStatus::Completed(...)` or `TaskStatus::Failed(...)` and injects it. The `workflow_start` tool in `librefang-runtime/src/tool_runner.rs` is updated to forward its `caller_agent_id` and `session_id` to the new tracked variant so any `workflow_start` invocation from an agent loop is auto-tracked without touching the tool surface. Cron / trigger callers that don't carry an `(agent, session)` keep their previous fire-and-forget behaviour unchanged because the tracker registration is gated behind both ids parsing successfully. Step-1 defaults honoured verbatim: delete-on-delivery (registry entry removed the moment `TaskCompletionEvent` is built, before the injection attempt completes; session history is the durable record); agent-side timeout (no global default, no kernel-side GC sweep); `TaskStatus::Failed(String)` (free-form failure message). `complete_async_task` is idempotent — a second call for the same `TaskId` (e.g. retry-after-error in a future supervisor) hits an empty registry slot and returns `Ok(false)` without emitting a duplicate signal. `BTreeMap` was the initial choice for the registry but switched to `HashMap` after the step-1 types deliberately did not derive `Ord` on `TaskId`; the registry is accessed by exact-key lookup only and never iterated to build an LLM-bound prompt, so the #3298 deterministic-ordering rule does not apply. New file `crates/librefang-kernel/src/kernel/task_registry.rs` (the registry methods); new field `async_tasks: parking_lot::Mutex<HashMap<TaskId, PendingTask>>` on `EventSubsystem`; new variant `AgentLoopSignal::TaskCompleted { event: TaskCompletionEvent }` in `librefang-types/src/tool.rs`; new agent-loop helper `format_task_completion_text` that renders the event as a `[System] [ASYNC_RESULT]` line consumed by the existing mid-turn injection path (step 3 will refine this into a typed turn-start trigger with `[async_tasks]` config). Tests: 7 `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` in `crates/librefang-kernel/tests/async_task_tracker_test.rs` — registry insert + lookup, workflow-kind completion delivers `TaskCompleted` signal with the right `run_id` and `Completed(value)` payload, delegation-kind delivers with the right target `AgentId` + `prompt_hash` + `Failed(msg)` payload, idle path (no live receiver) still removes the registry entry, unknown `TaskId` returns `Ok(false)` without panic, double-completion is a no-op on the second call (only one signal lands on the channel), and a sanity check that `librefang_kernel::workflow::WorkflowRunId` and `librefang_types::task::WorkflowRunId` are the same nominal type after the re-export migration. Verified with `cargo check --workspace --lib`, `cargo clippy -p librefang-kernel --lib -- -D warnings`, `cargo clippy -p librefang-runtime --lib -- -D warnings`, `cargo test -p librefang-kernel --test async_task_tracker_test` (7/7 pass), `cargo test -p librefang-kernel --test workflow_integration_test` (4/4 pass — `WorkflowRunId` re-export migration is transparent), `cargo test -p librefang-runtime --test tool_runner_workflow_write` (12/12 pass — the stub override migrated to `start_workflow_async_tracked`). Also fixes a pre-existing `dead_code` build failure on `librefang_channels::http_client::warn_ws_proxy_bypass` that blocked `cargo check --workspace --lib` on the wt-4983 worktree (the function is only reachable behind `channel-slack` / `channel-discord` / `channel-mattermost` features; gated the `pub(crate) fn` on the same `any(feature = ...)` clause that gates its callers, plus `test` so the existing smoke test still compiles). Refs #4983. Refs #5033. (@houko)

- **Async task tracker types — typed handle for non-blocking workflow / delegation results (step 1/3)** (#4983). First of three PRs landing the kernel-level async task tracker proposed in the issue. Today, an agent that calls `workflow_run` blocks its conversation loop for the entire duration of the workflow; if the workflow takes minutes, the agent is unresponsive to every other inbound message and a tool-layer timeout surfaces as a dead-end with no `run_id`. The `workflow_start` (async) variant returns a `run_id` immediately but has no mechanism to deliver the eventual result back into the agent's session — by the next user turn the agent has moved on. Production fallout was a Telegram-assistant agent (`ltdata`) being bricked for the duration of a multi-minute workflow run, with the user seeing nothing and an orchestrator agent burning ~$2/day polling the same gap shut. This PR is **types-only** at the bottom of the crate DAG so the kernel and runtime work that lands in steps 2 and 3 has a stable interface to import — no behaviour change, no kernel wiring, no agent-loop changes. New module `crates/librefang-types/src/task.rs` adds: `TaskId(pub Uuid)` (newtype with `new()` / `Default` / `Display` / `FromStr`) — kernel-assigned identifier for a registered async task; `WorkflowRunId(pub Uuid)` (same shape) — colocated here because `librefang-types` cannot import the kernel and step 2 will migrate the kernel's own `WorkflowRunId` to this canonical definition; `TaskKind` — `#[serde(tag = "kind", rename_all = "snake_case")]` enum with `Workflow { run_id }` and `Delegation { agent_id, prompt_hash }` variants, externally tagged so additive variants in steps 2/3 (`ExternalWebhook`, `LongRunningTool`, …) do not break wire compatibility with already-registered handles; `TaskHandle { id, kind, started_at }` — the typed handle returned synchronously to an agent that spawns an async task, holdable across turns; `TaskStatus` — `#[serde(tag = "status", content = "value")]` enum with `Pending` / `Running` / `Completed(serde_json::Value)` / `Failed(String)` / `Cancelled` arms; `TaskCompletionEvent { handle, status, completed_at }` — the wire payload the kernel will inject into the originating agent's session in step 2. Three design decisions are defaulted in module-level rustdoc and called out for re-discussion in steps 2/3: **(1) Cleanup semantics** — a registered task is removed from the kernel registry the moment its `TaskCompletionEvent` is delivered into the originating session; no retention window, no replay, session history is the durable record. **(2) Timeout ownership** — timeouts are agent-side. The spawning agent passes a deadline when it registers the task; the kernel does not impose a global default, keeping the "how long is too long for THIS operation?" policy with the caller that actually knows the answer. **(3) Error shape** — `TaskStatus::Failed(String)` is conservative on purpose. A richer typed-error variant can land later as an additive enum arm without breaking on-disk or wire formats (serde will continue to deserialise the existing `String` form, and new variants deserialise into their own arms). Module re-exports surfaced from `crates/librefang-types/src/lib.rs`: `TaskCompletionEvent`, `TaskHandle`, `TaskId`, `TaskKind`, `TaskStatus`, `WorkflowRunId`. Tests in `crates/librefang-types/src/task.rs` (6 unit tests, all wire-format round-trips against serde_json): `task_status_serde_roundtrip` (Pending / Running / Completed-with-JSON-payload / Failed-with-message / Cancelled all survive the round-trip), `task_kind_serde_roundtrip` (Workflow + Delegation variants), `task_completion_event_full_roundtrip` (the full struct including nested handle + status), `task_status_failed_preserves_message` (pins the error-shape contract — a free-form failure message is faithfully preserved across the wire), `task_completion_event_delegation_roundtrip` (delegation kind + Cancelled status combination), `task_id_display_and_parse_roundtrip` (Display / FromStr symmetry). **Step 2** (separate PR) will add the kernel pending-task registry and the event-injection path on `EventBus`; **step 3** (separate PR) will teach the agent loop to recognise the injected `TaskCompletionEvent` and surface it as a new turn. Verified with `cargo check -p librefang-types --lib`, `cargo clippy -p librefang-types --lib --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test -p librefang-types --lib task::` (6/6 pass). Refs #4983. (@houko)


- **Workflow `Branch` operator executor (#4980 step 4/N)** — wires the previously-stubbed `StepMode::Branch` to exact-match dispatch on the previous step's output. The dispatcher parses the previous output as JSON when possible (so numeric and structural match values compare by JSON deep-equality), iterates the arms in declaration order, and forward-jumps to the first matching `arm.then` step by name. No arm matches → run halts with `WorkflowRunState::Failed` and a reason naming the unmatched output (truncated at 200 chars so a multi-MB predecessor output cannot blow up the error string). Target step missing → halt with a reason naming the missing target. Target step at or before the current index → halt with a "backward jumps not allowed" reason — `Loop` already exists for that semantic, so a Branch that targets backwards is almost always an operator typo and silently allowing it would let an unbounded loop hide inside a Branch. The decided arm is recorded in the synthetic `StepResult.prompt` as `branch -> '<target>' (arm <idx>)` so the dashboard run history surfaces *which* arm fired without re-resolving the comparison. Skipped arms are skipped — no `_operator:branch` `StepResult` is emitted for the arms that did not match. Design decision (deferred from step 1, locked in step 4): exact equality on V1 matching the proposal in step 1's PR body. Range / regex / in-set matchers can land as additive `BranchArm` fields later (`match_range`, `match_regex` with exactly-one-of validation) without breaking the wire format. Forward jumps only — backward jumps would let an unbounded loop hide inside Branch when `Loop` already covers that. Tests: 3 new integration tests in `workflow_operator_nodes_test.rs` (`branch_step_arm_hit_routes_to_target_and_skips_intermediate_steps` driving two separate workflows with different seed literals and target terminals; each run's step trail is asserted to skip the two intermediate Transform steps that sit between the Branch and the named target; `branch_step_no_arm_match_halts_workflow_with_recorded_reason` covering the explicit-halt path with the full step trail asserted; `branch_step_no_match_solo_halts_workflow` pinning the single-step Branch path). Tests now total 14 in the operator-node integration test file (was 11 → +3 new Branch tests, -1 old stub test retired). Refs #4980, #5035 (step 1), #5044 (step 2), #5046 (step 3). (@houko)

- **Workflow `Transform` operator executor with Tera (#4980 step 3/N)** — wires the previously-stubbed `StepMode::Transform` to a Tera-rendered template against the previous step's output. The template context exposes `prev` (raw string), `prev_json` (only when the predecessor output parses as JSON, so a template that references `prev_json` against a non-JSON predecessor surfaces a clear "variable not found" Tera error rather than silently rendering empty), and `vars` (a `BTreeMap<String, String>` of `output_var`-bound workflow variables — `BTreeMap` for deterministic iteration order per #3298 so prompt caches stay valid). Tera was picked over `mlua` / `rhai` / a hand-rolled DSL because it ships sandboxed by default (no I/O, no shell escape, bounded recursion), is MIT-licensed and well-maintained, and adds the smallest delta to the dependency tree. `shell_exec` was explicitly NOT considered. Render failures (missing variable, syntax error reached at run time) halt the run with the Tera error wrapped as `transform render failed: <Tera message>` — Tera errors include line / column information, so the operator can pin the bad placeholder without re-running the workflow. New `Workflow::validate()` method on `librefang_kernel::workflow::Workflow` parses every `StepMode::Transform` template at manifest-load time and surfaces syntax errors as `Vec<(step_name, reason)>`, so an unterminated `{{ prev` or `{% if %}` without `{% endif %}` blows up before any run starts rather than at run time. The rendered template replaces `current_input` so downstream `{{input}}` consumers see the formatted output. Adds `tera = "1"` as a new workspace dependency (default-features disabled — the renderer is sandboxed; the `builtins` feature that adds filesystem-touching functions stays off). Tests: 3 new integration tests in `workflow_operator_nodes_test.rs` (happy template render, missing-variable halt with recorded reason, syntax error caught at load time via `validate`); 7 new kernel unit tests covering raw-prev render, `prev_json` indexing, `vars.<name>` exposure, missing-variable error wrapper, the `validate_transform_template` parse helper happy and failure paths, and `Workflow::validate` surfacing transform-step errors with step names attached. Refs #4980, #5035 (step 1), #5044 (step 2). (@houko)

- **Workflow `Gate` operator executor (#4980 step 2/N)** — wires the previously-stubbed `StepMode::Gate` to a declarative comparator AST evaluated against the previous step's output, so workflows can express "branch on score > 0.8" / "status == approved" / "tags contains beta" without an LLM call. The shape locked in from step 1's deferred-design slot: `Gate { condition: GateCondition }` where `GateCondition` is `{ field: Option<String> (RFC 6901 JSON Pointer), op: GateOp, value: serde_json::Value }` and `GateOp` is the boring `Eq | Ne | Gt | Lt | Gte | Lte | Contains` set. Typed AST chosen over a string DSL because a string would force a one-shot wire-format commitment incompatible with a future richer expression language; this shape is additive — new operators (regex, in-set, range) land as new `GateOp` variants without touching anything else. The executor `evaluate_gate_condition` resolves the JSON Pointer into the previous step's output (falling back to raw-string compare when the output isn't JSON), runs the operator (numeric path for ordering ops when both sides parse as f64, lexicographic otherwise; deep JSON equality for `Eq`/`Ne`; substring for `Contains`), and either routes execution onwards (pass) or halts the run with `WorkflowRunState::Failed` and a recorded reason naming the gate / field / op (fail). The blocking step still appears in `run.step_results` so the dashboard run history surfaces *which* gate stopped the workflow; the step's `output` field carries the failure reason for inline display. A malformed condition (missing `op`, unknown operator, wrong types) surfaces as a serde deserialisation error at manifest-load time — the gate cannot default to "passing" silently. The HTTP `POST /api/workflows` route's flat-string `"gate"` parser now reads `condition` as a typed object through `serde_json::from_value::<GateCondition>` and fails closed (`Eq` against `Value::Null`, which fails any real input) on malformed payloads rather than the previous silent "default to empty string" behaviour. Approval stays a no-op-with-warn — explicitly blocked on #4983 (async-task tracker) which is being driven in parallel; the warn message and an in-source `TODO(#4983)` marker call out the cross-issue dependency so the stub state is self-documenting. Integration tests in `crates/librefang-api/tests/workflow_operator_nodes_test.rs`: 4 new `#[tokio::test]` cases (`gate_step_passes_and_routes_onwards`, `gate_step_fails_and_halts_workflow_with_recorded_reason`, `gate_step_malformed_condition_fails_deserialization_at_load_time`, `gate_step_completed_when_field_omitted_compares_whole_input`) plus the old `gate_step_is_noop_with_warn_and_completes` retired. Kernel unit tests: 6 new in `librefang_kernel::workflow::tests` covering the comparator AST, the resolver fallback paths, and the deserialisation-failure-on-missing-`op` contract. Refs #4980, #5035 (step 1). (@houko)

- **Workflow operator-node step modes (#4980 step 1/N) — `Wait` executor + types-only landing for `Gate` / `Approval` / `Transform` / `Branch`**. Every workflow step previously required an agent dispatch, which meant a real LLM call for trivial control-flow operations like "wait 5 minutes", "branch on score > 0.8", or "render the output as Markdown" — wasting tokens and forcing the dashboard's visual editor to expose every node as an agent-shaped box. This PR adds five new variants to `librefang_kernel::workflow::StepMode` so workflow definitions can express zero-LLM-token operations: `Wait { duration_secs: u64 }`, `Gate { condition: String }`, `Approval { recipients: Vec<String>, timeout_secs: Option<u64> }`, `Transform { code: String }`, and `Branch { arms: Vec<BranchArm> }` where `BranchArm` is a new public struct `{ match_value: serde_json::Value, then: String }`. The match value is a typed `serde_json::Value` rather than a stringified expression so downstream tooling (dashboard, dry-run linter, future workflow analyzer) can inspect the branch tree without re-parsing. All five variants serde-round-trip cleanly — verified by 7 new `librefang-kernel::workflow::tests` cases (`test_step_mode_wait_serialization`, `test_step_mode_gate_serialization`, `test_step_mode_approval_serialization`, `test_step_mode_approval_timeout_optional` pinning the absent-`timeout_secs` case from the issue's TOML example, `test_step_mode_transform_serialization`, `test_step_mode_branch_serialization`). Only `Wait` is fully wired in this PR: its executor in the sequential workflow loop calls `tokio::time::sleep(duration_secs)` raced against the run's `cancel_notify` so a long Wait (e.g. `Wait { 86400 }`) still honours `WorkflowEngine::cancel_run` at sub-step granularity instead of ignoring it for a full day; records a synthetic `StepResult` with `agent_name = "_operator:wait"`, `agent_id = ""`, `input_tokens = 0`, `output_tokens = 0`, and `duration_ms` reflecting the actual sleep; preserves `current_input` verbatim so downstream `{{input}}` and `output_var` substitutions still work. The other four variants land as no-op executors that emit a structured `warn!` log (`<variant> executor not yet implemented — refs #4980`) and return success, with a shared `record_operator_noop_step_result` helper so all four arms read identically and tag the step result with `_operator:gate` / `_operator:approval` / `_operator:transform` / `_operator:branch` for log-side discoverability. The no-op-with-warn shape keeps the wire format usable from day one — workflows that include these variants serialise, persist to SQLite, and round-trip through pause/resume without error — while leaving the design questions on each variant's body open: Gate.condition string-form vs declarative shape (`{ field: "score", op: "gt", value: 0.8 }`), Approval operator-identity model (per-channel UUIDs vs free-form strings vs the #4977 `Recipient` type), Transform.code expression-language vs registered-functions (Tera/Handlebars/Rhai/WASM extension), and Branch jump semantics + default-arm shape. The HTTP `POST /api/workflows` route's `parse_step_mode` learns five new flat-string forms (`"wait"`, `"gate"`, `"approval"`, `"transform"`, `"branch"`) that pull their config from sibling fields on the step JSON object, mirroring the legacy `"conditional"` / `"loop"` shape so the dashboard and the TOML examples in the issue body can write `mode = "wait"` with sibling `duration_secs = 5`. Integration tests in `crates/librefang-api/tests/workflow_operator_nodes_test.rs`: 6 `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` cases driving the engine directly with a `panicking_agent_resolver` + `panicking_send_message` pair that pins the contract "operator-node executors must never dispatch to an agent" — `wait_step_completes_after_duration_and_skips_agent_dispatch` (elapsed ≥ 950ms lower-bound, output preserved, step result fields), `wait_step_zero_duration_completes_immediately`, and one no-op-with-warn smoke per Gate / Approval / Transform / Branch asserting Completed state and the matching `_operator:<kind>` tag. The DAG executor branch is intentionally untouched in this PR — it does not match on `StepMode`, so operator nodes in DAG workflows would attempt an agent dispatch; widening the DAG executor lands as a follow-up alongside the four no-op-with-warn executor bodies (the remaining four variants are each scoped as their own follow-up PR so the deferred design questions can be debated independently rather than bundled). Refs #4980. (@houko)


- **Declarative `[[triggers]]` in `agent.toml`** (#5014). Event triggers can now be declared in the manifest alongside the existing API/CLI creation paths, so trigger definitions live with the agent in version control, migrate with the workspace, and are recreated reproducibly after a fresh install or reset. New `ManifestTrigger` shape (`pattern` / `prompt_template` / `max_fires` / `cooldown_secs` / `session_mode` / `target_agent` / `workflow_id` / `enabled`) on `AgentManifest`. On agent spawn, hot-reload (`POST /api/agents/{id}/reload`), and daemon boot, the kernel reconciles the manifest list against the existing `trigger_jobs.json` store: missing entries are created, matching `(pattern, prompt_template)` keys have their mutable fields updated in place (TOML wins), and runtime-only triggers created via `POST /api/triggers` or `librefang trigger create` are governed by a new per-agent `reconcile_orphans` field (`"keep"` default — never delete an API-created trigger silently; `"warn"` — log; `"delete"` — reap). The reconcile is idempotent: re-applying the same manifest is a no-op, no persist thrash. `target_agent` is declared by **name** in the TOML and resolved to an `AgentId` at reconcile time via the registry's `find_by_name`; unresolved names log a warning and register the trigger without a target rather than failing the whole reconcile. Invalid pattern entries are skipped with a per-entry warning so one malformed `[[triggers]]` block never aborts the rest. Tests: 6 unit in `librefang_types::agent::tests` (defaults, full-shape parse, per-field defaults, `OrphanPolicy` serde, TOML round-trip), 11 unit in `librefang_kernel::triggers::tests::reconcile_*` (create / update / idempotency / each `OrphanPolicy` arm / name resolution / unresolvable target / invalid pattern skip / `"task_posted"` string normalisation / `enabled=false` persists), 5 integration in `crates/librefang-api/tests/declarative_triggers_test.rs` (register-on-spawn, idempotency across reloads, Keep preserves API-created, Delete reaps API-created, in-place update with stable id). Closes #5014. (@houko)



- **`librefang-rl-export`: security & reliability hardening on PR #5034 review** (#3331). Five blocking review items addressed inside the rl-export crate; no kernel-wide surface change. (1) **Rename** `TrajectoryExport` → `RlTrajectoryExport` so the public type stops colliding with the kernel's `TrajectoryExporter` (session audit trail vs RL rollout egress — two entirely different concepts). (2) **`*_env` indirection on every secret-bearing field**: `ExportTarget::WandB.api_key: String` → `api_key_env: String` (env-var name), same for `Tinker.api_key_env`; resolution happens at upload time via `resolve_env_secret()`, fail-closed with `InvalidConfig` on missing / empty env var. Matches the workspace `client_secret_env` / `api_key_env` convention and keeps secrets out of `config.toml`. (3) **SSRF egress allowlist**: new `crate::ssrf` module duplicates the policy of `librefang_runtime_mcp::mcp_oauth::is_ssrf_blocked_url` (loopback / RFC-1918 / link-local / IMDS / userinfo-smuggling / non-http schemes / IPv4-mapped-and-NAT64 IPv6 all rejected) with two modes — `Public` for W&B / Tinker, `LoopbackOrPrivate` for Atropos — gated in the public `export()` entry point before any I/O. Atropos's implicit `http://localhost:8000` default is removed: `base_url` is now `String` (required), so operators make the loopback decision explicitly and the variant can never accidentally hit a public host. W&B's `entity: Option<String>` is now `String` (required) — the prior `"default"` fallback was a guess at an undocumented W&B "personal entity" convention that would silently land runs under a wrong-named bucket. (4) **Redaction of `toolset_metadata`** before egress: new `crate::redact` module mirrors the kernel's `RedactionPolicy` regex set (`api_key`-shaped strings, JWTs, long base64 blobs) and is applied to the metadata blob in both the W&B `create-run` body and the Tinker `create_session` body. The two regex sets are intentionally duplicated rather than imported because pulling `librefang-kernel` into a leaf egress crate inverts the dep layer (the kernel must not depend on rl-export) and drags ~50 transitive crates for three patterns; the two sets must change together — flagged in the module rustdoc. (5) **Retry with exponential backoff** on transient failures: new `crate::retry` module wraps every upload call (W&B create-run + upload-file, Tinker create-session + telemetry, Atropos register-env + scored_data) in 3 attempts with 200ms / 400ms backoff. `is_transient` matches the workspace-standard set — network drops, 5xx, 429 — and leaves `AuthError`, `InvalidConfig`, 4xx (non-429), `MalformedResponse`, and `TrainerNotReady` permanent. Linked review nits resolved in the same commit (in scope per the "fix what you found" rule): `ExportError` now `#[non_exhaustive]`; dedicated `TrainerNotReady { status_label }` variant replaces the synthetic-503-from-200-sentinel hack so the condition is pattern-matchable without parsing the body and no longer collides with a real 503; `ExportTarget::Atropos` gains optional `max_token_length` / `group_size` / `weight` tuning knobs so operators don't have to fork the crate; Tinker `tags` sorted before send for byte-identical wire output (refs #3298 prompt-cache determinism); parameter shadowing `export: export` renamed to `payload`; "Step 1 of 3" framing dropped from the crate-level rustdoc. Tests: +6 (2 new security E2E — `wandb::tests::toolset_metadata_is_redacted_before_upload` asserts a `sk-live-…` literal in tool-result metadata is replaced with `<REDACTED:CREDENTIAL>` in the mock-received body; `tests::export_rejects_tinker_base_url_at_imds` asserts a Tinker base_url at `169.254.169.254` surfaces as `InvalidConfig`, not a successful upload; `tests::export_rejects_atropos_public_base_url` asserts Atropos at a public host is also rejected) plus 11 unit tests across the new `ssrf` / `redact` / `retry` / env-secret helpers; previously-failing tests rewritten for the new signature. Verification: `cargo check --workspace --lib`, `cargo clippy -p librefang-rl-export --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test -p librefang-rl-export` (46 passed, 0 failed). Refs PR #5034 review. (@houko)

- **New `librefang-rl-export` crate — long-horizon RL rollout trajectory exporter, W&B integration first** (#3331). Step 1 of 3 on the issue. Adds `crates/librefang-rl-export/` with the public surface (`ExportTarget`, `TrajectoryExport`, `ExportReceipt`, `export()`, `ExportError`) plus a private `wandb` module implementing the Weights & Biases REST flow: `POST {base}/api/runs` to create the run, then `POST {base}/files/<entity>/<project>/<run_id>` to upload the opaque trajectory bytes as a single file artefact under that run. Authentication uses W&B's documented HTTP Basic convention with the literal user `api` and the API key as the password (`Authorization: Basic base64("api:<key>")`); 401 / 403 collapse into `ExportError::AuthError` so the operator is prompted to refresh credentials rather than seeing the raw rejected token echoed back from some upstream error bodies, other non-2xx responses surface as `ExportError::UpstreamRejected { status, body }` with the body truncated to 4 KiB so a pathological upstream cannot bloat the error. All outbound HTTP flows through `librefang_http::proxied_client()` — the workspace shared client carrying the operator's `[proxy]` config, TLS fallback roots, and the canonical `User-Agent: librefang/<version>` — so this crate adds no bespoke reqwest plumbing per the `librefang-extensions` AGENTS.md "no bespoke `reqwest::Client`" rule. The exporter is intentionally **wire-format-agnostic**: `TrajectoryExport.trajectory_bytes: Vec<u8>` is opaque and forwarded to the upstream verbatim, so this crate does **not** depend on #3330's wire-format RFC and can land and be integration-tested today; once #3330 locks the on-the-wire serialization the exporter API is unchanged. `ExportTarget` is `#[non_exhaustive]` so the follow-up PRs (#3331 step 2 — Tinker; #3331 step 3 — Atropos) add additive variants without breaking callers. Tests: 6 `#[tokio::test]` cases in `crates/librefang-rl-export/src/wandb.rs` against `wiremock::MockServer` (`export_happy_path_creates_run_then_uploads_bytes` pins the two-call sequence, the Basic-auth header shape, and the `target_run_url` / `bytes_uploaded` receipt fields; `export_falls_back_to_default_entity_when_unset` pins that the upload path uses the `default` placeholder so W&B resolves the personal entity server-side; `export_maps_401_to_auth_error` and `export_maps_other_4xx_to_upstream_rejected_with_body` pin the status-classification split; `empty_api_key_is_rejected_before_any_http` pins the `InvalidConfig` short-circuit by pointing at an invalid base URL that must never be contacted; `basic_auth_uses_api_user_placeholder` pins the `api:<key>` Basic-auth convention so a future refactor cannot silently switch to a bare-key shape). Refs #3331. (@houko)

- **`librefang-rl-export`: Atropos exporter** (#3331 step 3 of 3). Additive `ExportTarget::Atropos { project, base_url }` variant on the existing `#[non_exhaustive]` enum + new private `atropos` module — non-breaking against the W&B (step 1) and Tinker (step 2) PRs. Atropos (<https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos>) is NousResearch's LLM RL environments framework — a FastAPI microservice mediating between rollout producers and a trainer process, running locally (default `http://localhost:8000`) with no auth (`atroposlib/api/server.py` adds `CORSMiddleware` but no auth middleware). The exporter maps the rollout onto Atropos's producer-side `register-env` / `scored_data` pair: `POST {base}/register-env` to register this rollout under a `desired_name` and recover the server-assigned `env_id` + `wandb_name` (request body matches the `RegisterEnv` Pydantic model: `max_token_length`, `desired_name`, `weight`, `group_size`, `min_batch_allocation`), then `POST {base}/scored_data` to submit the opaque trajectory bytes verbatim as a `ScoredData` JSON payload (`Content-Type: application/json`). `TrajectoryExport.trajectory_bytes` MUST already be valid `ScoredData` JSON for Atropos (`tokens`/`masks`/`scores`/...); the exporter forwards the bytes verbatim and lets Atropos validate — invalid payloads surface as `UpstreamRejected{status: 422, body}` with Atropos's Pydantic error body. Default `base_url` is `http://localhost:8000` matching the Atropos `run-api` default; `ExportTarget::Atropos.base_url: Option<String>` lets operators override (tests use this for `wiremock::MockServer`). **Trainer-not-ready handling**: Atropos's `register-env` is gated by `app.state.started` — if the trainer process hasn't called `/register` (a trainer-only endpoint NOT in this exporter's surface), the server returns HTTP 200 with the sentinel body `{"status": "wait for trainer to start"}` and *no* `env_id`. The exporter detects the missing `env_id` and converts that overloaded 200-as-busy into a synthetic `UpstreamRejected { status: 503, body }` so callers see a retry-after-trainer-up signal rather than `MalformedResponse`. `ExportReceipt.target_run_url` returns `{base}/latest_example#env={wandb_name}` — Atropos has no browser-loadable run-URL concept (it's a local microservice) but `/latest_example` is its documented debug-inspection endpoint, so an operator can `curl {base}/latest_example` to verify the upload landed. Error-classification mirrors the W&B / Tinker exporters exactly (401/403 → `AuthError` for reverse-proxy-fronted deployments; other non-2xx → `UpstreamRejected{status,body}` truncated to 4 KiB); all HTTP flows through `librefang_http::proxied_client()`. Tests: 6 `#[tokio::test]` in `crates/librefang-rl-export/src/atropos.rs` against `wiremock::MockServer` mirroring the W&B / Tinker test shape (`export_happy_path_registers_env_then_submits_scored_data` pins the two-call sequence + `RegisterEnv` body shape via `body_partial_json` + `ScoredData` payload round-trip + receipt URL with the server-assigned `wandb_name`; `export_translates_trainer_not_ready_to_upstream_rejected_503` pins the sentinel 200-as-busy → synthetic 503 conversion so this contract cannot silently break; `export_maps_401_to_auth_error_for_proxy_fronted_deployments` pins the auth-collapse for reverse-proxied deployments; `export_maps_422_validation_failure_to_upstream_rejected_with_body` pins Atropos's Pydantic 422 path with the upstream body forwarded; `empty_project_is_rejected_before_any_http` and `empty_trajectory_bytes_is_rejected_before_any_http` pin the `InvalidConfig` short-circuit against a base URL that must never be contacted). Closes #3331. (@houko)

- **`librefang-rl-export`: Tinker exporter** (#3331 step 2 of 3). Additive `ExportTarget::Tinker { api_key, project, base_url }` variant on the existing `#[non_exhaustive]` enum + new private `tinker` module — non-breaking against the W&B-only PR. Tinker's public REST surface (<https://thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/>, SDK at <https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker>) is built around training calls (`/api/v1/forward`, `/api/v1/forward_backward`, `/api/v1/optim_step`) and session-scoped telemetry; there is no Tinker-side "opaque trajectory upload" endpoint today. The exporter maps the rollout onto the closest stable two-call pair Tinker actually accepts: `POST {base}/api/v1/create_session` to register a session and recover its server-assigned `session_id`, then `POST {base}/api/v1/telemetry` to submit a single `GenericEvent` whose `event_data` carries the base64-encoded opaque trajectory bytes + rollout window timestamps + caller-side run id under that session. Default base URL `https://tinker.thinkingmachines.dev/services/tinker-prod` matches the Tinker Python SDK's `TINKER_BASE_URL` fallback; `ExportTarget::Tinker.base_url: Option<String>` lets operators on a self-hosted control plane override (tests point this at `wiremock::MockServer`). Authentication is `X-API-Key: <api_key>` per Tinker's `ApiKeyAuthProvider`; the SDK requires keys start with `tml-` but this crate forwards the key verbatim and lets the upstream enforce the prefix so JWT-style credentials surfaced by `TINKER_CREDENTIAL_CMD` still flow through. `ExportReceipt.target_run_url` returns the literal `{base}/api/v1/get_session/{session_id}` URL pattern that the Tinker SDK's `service.get_session(session_id)` convention exposes, so an operator can click through to the session. Error-classification mirrors the W&B exporter exactly (401/403 → `AuthError`; other non-2xx → `UpstreamRejected{status,body}` with body truncated to `MAX_ERROR_BODY_BYTES = 4096`); all HTTP flows through `librefang_http::proxied_client()` so the operator's `[proxy]` + TLS fallback apply uniformly. Tests: 6 `#[tokio::test]` in `crates/librefang-rl-export/src/tinker.rs` against `wiremock::MockServer` mirroring the W&B test shape (`export_happy_path_creates_session_then_submits_telemetry` pins the two-call sequence + `X-API-Key` header on both calls + receipt URL using the server-assigned session id; `export_forwards_trajectory_bytes_as_base64_event_data` pins the base64 wire shape via `body_partial_json` so a future refactor cannot silently switch encoding; `export_maps_401_to_auth_error` and `export_maps_other_4xx_to_upstream_rejected_with_body` pin the status-classification split; `empty_api_key_is_rejected_before_any_http` and `empty_project_is_rejected_before_any_http` pin the `InvalidConfig` short-circuit against a base URL that must never be contacted). Assumption flagged for maintainer review in the module-level rustdoc + the PR body: if Tinker ships a dedicated trajectory-upload endpoint in a future release, this module should switch to it; the `create_session + telemetry` pair is the closest stable target against the current SDK source. Refs #3331. (@houko)

- **Configurable prompt-cache breakpoint strategy for Anthropic and compatible providers** (#4970). The driver already placed cache breakpoints at system + tools-last + the last 3 messages (`system_and_3`, the strategy used by Hermes Agent for the ~75% input-token savings reported on Anthropic), but the placement was hard-coded — operators couldn't dial it back for thrashy workloads or disable it independently of the global `prompt_caching` master switch. New `[prompt_cache]` config section with `strategy = "disabled" | "system_only" | "system_and_<N>"` and `cache_ttl_hint_secs` (default `300`). `PromptCacheStrategy::SystemAndN(N)` is parametric — `N` is a *hint*; Anthropic's 4-breakpoint hard cap is enforced by the driver in most-stable-first order (system → tools-last → newest message backward), so `system_and_8` still emits at most 4 markers and never over-spends the budget. `prompt_caching = false` (master switch) wins over any per-request strategy, preserving the global kill switch for operators who don't want cache hints on any provider. Surface: a parsed string round-trips through `PromptCacheStrategy::FromStr` + custom serde with `deny_unknown_fields` on the section, so a typo like `strategy = "sytem_and_3"` fails at config load with an error pointing at the bad value instead of silently falling back to a default. Wire-through: kernel forwards `prompt_cache.strategy` as a string via existing per-agent manifest metadata; agent loop parses back into the enum and sets `CompletionRequest.prompt_cache_strategy`; only the Anthropic driver currently honours the field — OpenAI/DeepSeek cache automatically above their own length thresholds (no per-request annotation needed) and Gemini's `cached_content` API is deferred to a follow-up issue since it requires server-side context registration rather than per-request annotation.

- **New `web_fetch_to_file` tool — fetch a URL straight into a workspace file without round-tripping the body through the model** (#4964). Information-gathering agents (research, ingestion, scraping) previously had two bad options when `web_fetch` returned a body too large to want in context: regenerate it through `file_write` (burning tokens proportional to the body) or lose it. The escape hatch — `shell_exec curl ...` — was blocked under `Allowlist` mode by `contains_shell_metacharacters` (`?`/`&`/`*` in URLs trip the metachar check at `tool_runner.rs:1355-1369`), and a downgrade to `Full` mode also lifts every other shell restriction on that agent — not the trade-off researchers asked for. New built-in `web_fetch_to_file(url, dest_path)` (`crates/librefang-runtime/src/web_fetch_to_file.rs`) streams the response body directly to a workspace-relative path; the agent receives only a short summary line (`Wrote N bytes to ... (sha256:..., content-type: ..., status: ...)`). Same SSRF protection, DNS pinning, and redirect re-validation as `web_fetch` (reuses `WebFetchEngine::pinned_client` and `check_ssrf`, now exposed `pub(crate)`); same taint scans (`check_taint_net_fetch` / outbound text / outbound header) in the dispatch arm; same workspace-jail and read-only named-workspace pre-flight checks as `file_write`. `WebFetchConfig.max_file_bytes` (default 50 MiB) caps download size; per-call `max_bytes` is clamped down to this hard ceiling, never up. Stream-reads via `Response::chunk()` so a server that omits or lies about `Content-Length` cannot push past the cap. Lives in a new module rather than growing `tool_runner.rs`/`agent_loop.rs` (per `crates/librefang-runtime/CLAUDE.md`; both files are slated for #3710 split). Tests: 9 `#[tokio::test]` in `crates/librefang-runtime/tests/web_fetch_to_file_test.rs` (happy path with sha256 + content-type match, `..` rejection, absolute-path-outside-workspace rejection, configured `max_file_bytes` overflow, per-call clamp, SSRF loopback block, HTTP 4xx pass-through, missing required params), plus 5 `clamp_max_bytes` unit tests next to the impl.

- **Email channel: `tls_root_ca_path` and `tls_accept_invalid_certs` for self-hosted IMAP behind self-signed / expired certs** (#4877). The IMAP poll path used `RustlsConnector::new_with_native_certs()` with no operator-controlled escape hatch, so a self-hosted IMAP server behind a private CA (or with an expired self-signed cert) failed every poll with `TLS handshake failed: IO error: invalid peer certificate: certificate expired` and the only workaround was renewing the cert. Two new fields on `EmailConfig` cover the two real-world cases: (1) `tls_root_ca_path: Option<String>` — additionally trust certificates from a PEM file on top of the system root store; hostname / expiry / signature / chain validation **stay ON**. This is the recommended path for self-hosted IMAP behind a private CA. Multiple certs in one PEM are supported; missing file, empty file, and garbage non-PEM input each return a distinct error mentioning the path, so operators can locate the typo without reading source. (2) `tls_accept_invalid_certs: bool` (default `false`) — last-resort dev escape hatch that disables ALL certificate validation (hostname, expiry, signature, chain). Implemented as a custom `rustls::client::danger::ServerCertVerifier` that accepts unconditionally; advertises every standard `SignatureScheme` so peers don't filter the (no-op) verification. A WARN log fires on **every** IMAP connect attempt while this is enabled (every poll cycle and every flag-update RPC, ~30s default cadence), so the MITM-vulnerability stays visible in operator logs rather than being noticed once at startup and forgotten. Both knobs flow through new `EmailAdapter::with_tls_root_ca_path` / `with_tls_accept_invalid_certs` builder methods (no breaking change to `EmailAdapter::new`'s 11-arg signature). The TLS connector construction is factored into a single `build_imap_tls_connector` helper used by both `fetch_unseen_emails` and `mark_uids_outcome`, so the two TLS-using sites can never drift. Adds `rustls-pemfile = "2"` as a workspace dep for parsing the user-supplied PEM. Tests in `crates/librefang-channels/src/email.rs`: 7 new — default-validating connector, accept-invalid-certs opt-in, missing CA path (error mentions the path), empty CA file (error mentions "no PEM certificates"), garbage non-PEM file (same path), valid PEM CA loaded from a re-encoded native-store cert (skipped with `eprintln!` rather than failing on minimal CI images without `ca-certificates`), and an `EmailAdapter::with_tls_*` builder smoke test. Closes #4877. (@houko)

- **`[proactive_memory] extraction_model` honours provider-qualified ids** (#4871). Before this change, `crates/librefang-kernel/src/kernel/boot.rs:1325-1328` always routed proactive-memory extraction through `kernel.llm.default_driver`, regardless of what `extraction_model` named — the model string was passed through `strip_provider_prefix` for the *default* provider, then sent to the default driver. So on a deployment with `default_model.provider = "ollama"` and `extraction_model = "anthropic/haiku"`, every extraction call dispatched the Anthropic model name through the Ollama driver and 404'd upstream. Operators were forced to route extraction through whatever provider they happened to have as default, even when that was wildly suboptimal for the extraction workload (e.g., expensive default model burned on every turn's extraction while a cheap haiku/openrouter alternative was just one config edit away). The fix: `extraction_model` now accepts three forms — `provider:model` (consistent with `[llm.auxiliary]` chain spec), `provider/model` (consistent with `aliases.toml` and `default_model` shape), or a bare model name (legacy behaviour, routes to `default_driver`). The provider prefix is only honoured when the LHS is a **registered provider** per the live model catalog (`ModelCatalog::get_provider().is_some()`) — this avoids misparsing OpenRouter-style model ids like `google/gemini-2.5-flash` where `google` isn't a separate provider, so the whole string belongs to the configured default provider verbatim. Colon parsing is attempted first; quirky ollama tag suffixes like `qwen3:4b` fall through to bare because `qwen3` isn't a registered provider. Nested slashes (`openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku`) split on the FIRST `/` so the model id keeps the inner slash. When the resolved provider differs from the kernel's default, a fresh driver is built via `drivers::create_driver` with API key, base URL, proxy, request timeout, and MCP bridge config all resolved through the same paths the boot path uses for the primary driver — driver-build failure logs a WARN naming the spec + provider + cause and falls back to NO LLM extractor (proactive memory then uses substring extraction; explicit visible degradation beats silently 404'ing the operator's named provider on every turn). Bare model names continue to route through `default_driver` unchanged — fully backward-compatible. Note: this PR also **closes #4870** — the per-agent `[proactive_memory]` override shipped in #4885 but the original PR's body said "Closes #4870" inline rather than in a recognised GitHub keyword line, so the issue stayed open after merge. Tests: 8 in `librefang-kernel::kernel::boot::extraction_model_tests` (bare model, colon-form known provider, slash-form known provider, slash-form unknown LHS → bare, nested slash form, colon-form unknown LHS → bare, empty sides → bare, colon precedence over slash when both present). Closes #4871. Closes #4870. (@houko)

- **Per-agent `[proactive_memory]` override in `agent.toml`** (#4870). `[proactive_memory]` in `config.toml` sets a single, kernel-wide policy that forces the same `auto_memorize` / `auto_retrieve` flags on every spawned agent. On hosts that mix one chatty user-facing agent with cron-driven sub-agents (data collectors, ETL, brief composers), enabling `auto_memorize` globally costs an extraction LLM call per sub-agent turn for content that has no recall value — the reporter's `lifeos-daily-brief` deployment was burning ~200 extraction calls/day on agents whose tool-output extraction was pure noise. New `librefang_types::memory::ProactiveMemoryOverrides` struct with three optional fields (`enabled`, `auto_memorize`, `auto_retrieve`); each `Option<bool>` either inherits the global config (`None`) or supersedes it for this agent (`Some(b)`). Wired into `AgentManifest.proactive_memory` (`#[serde(default)]`, all-`None` default → inherit). The runtime gates at the call site: new `gated_proactive_memory_for_retrieve` / `gated_proactive_memory_for_memorize` helpers in `agent_loop.rs` consult `manifest.proactive_memory.resolve_*` against `store.config()` and pass `None` into `RecallSetupContext` / `FinalizeEndTurnContext` when the per-agent override disables the side. Boot caveat documented on the struct: the global `proactive_memory.enabled = false` short-circuits store construction, so per-agent `enabled = Some(true)` cannot resurrect a non-existent store — the supported shape is **per-agent opt-out** when the global is on (which matches the issue's actual use case). Resolution precedence: `enabled = Some(false)` wins over both per-field overrides; otherwise per-field `Some(b)` wins; otherwise fall back to the global config. Tests: 5 in `librefang-types::memory::tests` (default-inherits, per-field disable, master switch, global-off inheritance, serde round-trip preserving `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`). (@houko)

- **Per-channel proxy override on Telegram / Discord / Slack / Mattermost adapters** (#4795). Each adapter's `[[channels.<name>]]` block now accepts an optional `proxy = "http://…"` (or `https://`, `socks5://`, `socks5h://`, with optional `user:pass@`) that routes the adapter's `reqwest::Client` through the named proxy, overriding the process-level `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` env vars. Unset = today's behaviour (env-var fallback still applies). Centralized in a new `librefang_channels::http_client::new_proxied_client` helper plus a `with_proxy(Option<&str>)` builder method on each affected adapter; invalid URLs are rejected at adapter init with a `ChannelProxyError::InvalidUrl` carrying the offending value and reqwest's reason, and the channel-bridge logs the redacted URL and skips that one adapter rather than booting with the wrong proxy. Required enabling reqwest's `socks` feature in the workspace `Cargo.toml`. Scope: REST client only — gateway / Socket Mode / Mattermost WebSocket connections still use the platform's default network path. Auth in the proxy URL works automatically via reqwest. Tests: 8 in `librefang_channels::http_client::tests` (None / http / https / socks5 / socks5h / userinfo / garbage URL / scheme-list display), 4 each in `telegram::tests`, 2 each in `discord::tests` / `slack::tests` / `mattermost::tests` (adapter-init smoke), plus a serde round-trip across all four configs in `librefang_types::config::tests`. (@houko)

- **Skill workshop — passive after-turn capture of teaching signals** (#3328) (default-OFF; opt in per agent via `[skill_workshop] enabled = true` in `agent.toml`, matching the original #3328 acceptance criteria). New `librefang-kernel::skill_workshop` subsystem. Once enabled, an `AgentLoopEnd` hook (registered alongside `auto_dream` in `set_self_handle`) runs three regex scanners against the latest user message + recent tool history after every non-fork turn and produces draft `CandidateSkill` TOML files under `~/.librefang/skills/pending/<agent_uuid>/<candidate_uuid>.toml`. Three signals: `ExplicitInstruction` ("from now on always …", "every time …"; conversational subjects "I" / "we" / "you" filtered, trigger must sit at sentence-start), `UserCorrection` ("no, do it like …", "actually …"), `RepeatedToolPattern` (same tool sequence ≥ 3 turns, length-1 patterns require ≥ 4). Per-agent config in `agent.toml` `[skill_workshop]`: `enabled` (default false), `auto_capture` (default true), `approval_policy` ("pending" default / "auto"), `review_mode` ("heuristic" default / "threshold_llm" / "none"; `"both"` is a serde alias for `threshold_llm`), `max_pending` (default 20). Once enabled, the conservative knob set is heuristic-only review and pending policy — microseconds of regex per turn plus a few KB written when a candidate lands, no LLM call, no auto-promote. Operators that want LLM refinement opt in via `review_mode = "threshold_llm"`, which routes through a dedicated `AuxTask::SkillWorkshopReview` slot and the cheap-tier provider chain (haiku → gpt-4o-mini → openrouter-haiku); when no cheap-tier credentials are configured the workshop returns `Indeterminate` rather than billing the operator's primary provider, blocking a financial-DoS regression. Approval routes through `evolution::create_skill` (same path as marketplace skills) so the `SkillVerifier::scan_prompt_content` security gate runs at both `save_candidate` and `approve_candidate` — `prompt_context`, `description`, and both 800-char provenance excerpts are scanned at save; Critical hits abort with `SecurityBlocked` before any temp file is written. UUID validation guards every public storage entry point that addresses files by id, so a non-UUID id never reaches `Path::join`. CLI: `librefang skill pending list / show / approve / reject`; HTTP: `GET/POST /api/skills/pending[…]` (auth-gated, `WorkshopError::InvalidId` → 400, not-found → 404, security/conflict → 409); dashboard: `PendingSkillsSection` on the Skills page with Approve / Reject buttons (the section renders nothing while the queue is empty so it doesn't waste page space). Architecture doc at `docs/architecture/skill-workshop.md`. Tests: 56 in `librefang-kernel::skill_workshop` (heuristic / llm_review / storage / candidate / mod) + 13 integration in `librefang-api::skill_workshop_pending_routes_test` (status + side-effect read-back per the project's mandatory pattern, including UUID-validation 400 cases). (@houko)

### Fixed

- **macOS vault no longer locks at launchd startup; `ioreg` / `reg.exe` are resolved by absolute path instead of bare command name** (#5025). `collect_os_machine_id_material` at `crates/librefang-extensions/src/vault.rs` shelled out with `Command::new("ioreg")` on macOS and `Command::new("reg")` on Windows. The installer-generated launchd plist gives the daemon a minimal `PATH = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin` that excludes `/usr/sbin` — where `ioreg` lives — so the spawn ENOENT'd, the `if let Ok(...)` branch silently skipped, and the v3 keyring derivation produced a different wrap key than the one that wrote the keyring. Vault decrypted from an interactive shell (`/etc/zprofile` runs `path_helper` which adds `/usr/sbin`) but appeared locked under launchd; all vault-only secrets then dropped from the daemon's env by `librefang-dotenv`, breaking LLM providers and `env = ["VAULT_KEY"]` MCP wiring. Same anti-pattern applied to Windows `reg.exe` under a service-account context with a stripped PATH. The fix: new `resolve_command(candidates: &[&str])` helper picks the first absolute path that exists on disk, falling through to bare names only as a last resort; macOS now tries `/usr/sbin/ioreg`, `/sbin/ioreg`, `ioreg` in that order, Windows tries `C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe` then `reg`. Both call sites switched from `if let Ok(output) = ...` to an explicit `match` that emits a structured `warn!` log on `Err` (binary path + spawn error) AND on `Ok(_)` that yielded no UUID — eliminating the silent-failure mode that took multiple hours of `env -i` bisecting to diagnose. The warn log explicitly names #5025 so future operators searching daemon logs find the original issue immediately. Tests: 5 unit tests on `resolve_command` (`resolve_command_picks_first_existing_absolute` against `/bin/sh`, `_skips_missing_absolutes`, `_returns_last_when_all_absolutes_missing_and_no_bare`, `_skips_missing_windows_absolutes` against `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`, `_accepts_bare_name_without_filesystem_check`). Closes #5025. (@houko)

- **Approval notifications reach chats bound to the requesting agent even when the adapter has `default_agent = None`** (#5002). Follow-up to #4985 / #4994. The post-#4994 listener gates delivery on `router.channel_default(<channel_key>)`; for adapters configured with `default_agent = None` (operator routes purely via `AgentBinding`, e.g. one Telegram bot serving multiple agents with different per-chat ownership), that lookup returns `None` and the listener silently dropped every approval — the original #4985 silent-drop branch listed this as an operator-visible narrowing tracked for a follow-up. The fix adds `AgentRouter::bound_recipients_for_agent(agent_id, channel_str, account_id)` which walks the binding list and returns every `peer_id` whose `AgentBinding.agent` resolves (via `agent_name_cache`) to the requesting agent on this adapter's `(channel_type, account_id)`. The listener now falls back to that binding-derived recipient set when `channel_default` does not cover the requesting agent. Fan-out semantics: all bindings that match — picking one arbitrarily would be wrong (one operator-configured chat would lose the prompt) and re-narrowing to "primary" requires a config concept that doesn't exist; multi-chat fan-out is the cheapest correct default and only sends to chats the operator deliberately bound, so it does NOT re-open the cross-agent broadcast leak #4985 closed. Bindings without a `peer_id` (channel-only catch-all rules) are skipped — they name no chat to deliver to. Bindings whose `match_rule.account_id` is set must match the adapter's `account_id()` exactly; bindings whose `account_id` is unset apply to every adapter on that channel type (consistent with the inbound resolver's semantics). When `channel_default` returns `None` AND no binding covers the requesting agent on the adapter, the listener now logs a structured `warn!` (`adapter`, `account_id`, `channel`, `request_id`, `requesting_agent`) so operators see "approval dropped: no recipients for agent X on channel Y" instead of the previous silent drop — that visibility is the user-facing half of the regression and the warn-log promotion is intentional (operators previously had no way to tell whether an approval was misrouted or just slow). Trait-extension question (raised in the issue body) resolved in the negative: the binding store lives on `AgentRouter`, which `BridgeManager` already holds, so adding a `bound_recipients_for_agent` method on `ChannelAdapter` would have been redundant plumbing — querying the router directly keeps every adapter implementation untouched. Tests in `crates/librefang-channels/tests/bridge_integration_test.rs`: `test_approval_listener_falls_back_to_agent_binding_when_default_unset` (direct #5002 repro — `default_agent = None`, one `AgentBinding` chat-z → agent X, approval for X lands in chat-z), `test_approval_listener_binding_fallback_does_not_leak_cross_agent` (same setup, approval for a DIFFERENT agent Y must NOT be delivered — pins that the fallback path does not re-introduce the #4985 leak shape), `test_approval_listener_fans_out_to_all_bound_chats` (agent X bound to chat-z1 AND chat-z2 → both receive the notification, asserts exactly-2 with a 100ms over-slack to catch double-send regressions), `test_approval_listener_skips_binding_with_no_peer_id` (channel-only catch-all binding with no `peer_id` is correctly NOT a delivery target — pre-fix this would have crashed `adapter.send()` with an empty `platform_id`), `test_approval_listener_binding_respects_account_id_scope` (binding scoped to `account_id = "bot-a"` fires on bot-a but not on bot-b — mirrors the #4985 multi-bot leak shape at the binding layer). Closes #5002. (@houko)

- **Prompt-cache hits no longer trip the per-minute burst limit; Anthropic driver normalizes `TokenUsage` to the workspace OpenAI-shape convention** (#4943, #4958). Two coupled issues. (1) `AgentScheduler`'s sliding-window burst guard at `crates/librefang-kernel/src/scheduler.rs:284-290` summed `usage.total()` (= `input_tokens + output_tokens`) into the per-minute window, so an agent with a large stable prompt — e.g. ~50k tokens of MCP tool definitions hitting the prompt cache every turn — would trip `Token burst limit would be exceeded: 411909 + 32128 reserved in last minute (max 240000/min)` despite the model doing almost no new work (provider charges ~0.1x of input rate for cache reads). New `TokenUsage::burst_tokens()` on `librefang-types::message::TokenUsage` returns `input_tokens.saturating_sub(cache_read_input_tokens) + output_tokens`. `record_usage` and `settle_reservation` switch the sliding-window push to `burst_tokens()`; the hourly absolute quota (`tracker.total_tokens` against `max_llm_tokens_per_hour`) continues to use `usage.total()` because that knob is operator-facing "raw tokens per hour" by historical contract — the asymmetry is deliberate (hourly = budget, burst = rate control). (2) For that formula to work on every provider, the workspace needs a single convention for what `input_tokens` represents. `librefang-kernel-metering::estimate_cost_from_rates` had been built on the OpenAI shape (`input_tokens` is the TOTAL prompt count, `cache_read` is a subset), and the cost tests confirm this in the comments (`test_estimate_cost_cache_read_discount`: "1M total input tokens, 500k are cache-read"). But the Anthropic driver was passing through raw API values, which use the opposite convention (`input_tokens` excludes cache, cache buckets reported separately — https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages#response-usage). The result was silent: for every cache-using Anthropic turn `estimate_cost_from_rates`'s `saturating_sub` collapsed `regular_input` to 0, under-billing by the genuine new-input portion — and `budget` gates / dashboard rollups under-counted in the same direction. Anthropic driver now normalizes at the boundary (`convert_response` and the streaming `message_start` handler) by adding `cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens` into `TokenUsage.input_tokens` so the wire shape downstream consumers see is identical across providers. The pre-existing `estimate_cost_from_rates` is now correct on Anthropic without further change; the new `burst_tokens` is correct on both. `TokenUsage` struct docstring documents the single convention. Tests: 4 in `scheduler::tests` — `test_burst_limit_excludes_cache_read_tokens` (cache-read-heavy turn passes the burst check that previously failed, plus a follow-up cache-creation-heavy turn that still hits the cap because cache writes are inside `input_tokens` and do go through the model), `test_burst_tokens_pure_cache_hit_is_zero_new_work`, `test_burst_tokens_saturates_when_cache_read_exceeds_input` (no panic / no wrap on malformed payloads), `test_burst_tokens_counts_cache_creation` (OpenAI and Anthropic-post-normalization shapes both produce the same `1100` / `1150` expected burst). Closes #4943. Closes #4958. (@houko)

- **Agent detail page sorts skills alphabetically** (#4940 — partial). `renderSkillsTab`, the row-level skills preview (first-3 chips on agent cards), and the detail sidebar `Skills` section in `crates/librefang-api/dashboard/src/pages/AgentsPage.tsx` previously rendered skills in the backend's allowlist order — meaningless to humans scanning a long list. All three sites now `.slice().sort()` before rendering so the same agent's skills appear in the same order in every view. Plain codepoint sort (not `localeCompare`) because skill names are slug-shape ASCII IDs and `localeCompare` would flip ordering under non-en locales (tr-TR dotless-i, etc). The issue's MCP and Channels claims don't apply — those tabs don't exist on the agent detail page (Conversation / Memory / Skills / Schedule / Logs only); commented on the issue to clarify. (@houko)

- **Approval requests now reach channel adapters instead of being kernel-only** (#4875). `BridgeManager::start_approval_listener` (`crates/librefang-channels/src/bridge.rs`) was defined as `pub async fn`, documented as the path that subscribes to `EventPayload::ApprovalRequested` and forwards each request to running channel adapters, but no code in the workspace ever called it — a repo-wide search for `start_approval_listener` returned exactly one hit (the definition). The lone bridge-startup path `start_channel_bridge_with_config` (`crates/librefang-api/src/channel_bridge.rs`) registered adapters and spawned their inbound tasks but never invoked the listener, so an agent attached to a Telegram channel that triggered a tool in `approval.require_approval` produced a pending request visible via `GET /api/approvals?status=pending` and in the dashboard, but **nothing** arrived in the originating chat — no text prompt, no `/approve <id>` hint, no daemon-log entry for delivery. The pre-existing listener body was also a stub: it formatted the notification text but then only called `info!(...)` per adapter (with a `let _ = &msg;` to silence the unused-variable warning) — even if it had been wired up, no `ChannelAdapter::send()` would have fired. Three changes land the actual delivery path: (1) `start_channel_bridge_with_config` now calls `manager.start_approval_listener().await` after the adapter-registration loop, before returning the manager — only when at least one adapter started successfully, so an all-failed bridge does not leak a listener task; lifetime is tied to `BridgeManager::shutdown_tx`, so hot-reload cancels the listener together with the rest of the bridge. (2) The listener body now actually delivers: for each running adapter, it iterates `adapter.notification_recipients()` and calls `adapter.send(user, ChannelContent::Text(msg))`; the `adapters: Vec<Arc<dyn ChannelAdapter>>` parameter is dropped from the signature in favour of `self.adapters.clone()` since the manager already owns the adapter list (the old parameter only existed because the function was never called and the type system had nothing to enforce). Delivery is best-effort per-recipient — `send()` errors log a warning with `adapter`, `request_id`, `recipient` fields and continue to the next user, so a transient failure on one platform does not block the broadcast to the rest. (3) A new `ChannelAdapter::notification_recipients() -> Vec<ChannelUser>` trait method (default empty Vec) exposes each adapter's operator inbox. `TelegramAdapter` overrides it to project `allowed_users` into `ChannelUser`s, filtering out bare `@username` entries because Telegram `sendMessage` requires a numeric `chat_id` and there is no API call that resolves `@username → chat_id` without a prior message from that user (the bot has no way to DM a stranger by handle). Other adapters keep the default empty-Vec impl, which means they silently skip the broadcast rather than `panic!`-ing or fanning out to wrong recipients — group-only adapters that have no concept of an operator DM (Mastodon, Reddit) are correctly handled by the default; configuring per-adapter recipients on Discord / Slack / Signal / WhatsApp / WeChat is a follow-up override that the new trait method already supports without further plumbing. Inline-keyboard delivery for adapters that support it (Telegram inline keyboards, Slack Block Kit, Feishu cards) is also a follow-up — the current payload is plain text with the truncated 8-char approval ID and `/approve <id>` / `/reject <id>` instructions, which is enough to unblock the user-visible "nothing arrives in the chat" symptom. Test coverage in `crates/librefang-channels/tests/bridge_integration_test.rs`: `test_approval_listener_delivers_to_configured_recipients` builds a `BridgeManager` with a mock adapter that overrides `notification_recipients()`, wires a real `tokio::broadcast` event bus through a new `EventBusHandle`, emits an `ApprovalRequested` event, and asserts the adapter received exactly one `send()` carrying the approval id prefix, tool name, and `/approve` / `/reject` hints to the correct recipient; `test_approval_listener_skips_adapter_without_recipients` pins the default-empty-Vec contract so future adapters that forget to override stay silent instead of crashing the listener task. Closes #4875. (@houko)

- **Approval notifications no longer leak across agents and unrelated chats** (#4985). Privacy regression introduced by #4881 in `v2026.5.12-beta.11`: the new approval listener in `crates/librefang-channels/src/bridge.rs` (around the `for adapter in &adapters` loop) iterated **every** running channel adapter and **every** recipient declared by `ChannelAdapter::notification_recipients()`, with no reference to `approval.agent_id`. In multi-bot Telegram setups this meant an approval triggered by `agent-A` (its own dedicated 1:1 bot) was also delivered to the bot bound to unrelated `agent-B` and to every group chat that bot was a member of — exposing tool names, agent IDs, and the human-readable action description to chats that had nothing to do with the requesting agent. The fix scopes delivery via the `AgentRouter` already owned by `BridgeManager`: for each adapter the listener now builds the same channel key the bridge boot stores in `channel_defaults` (`<channel_type>` for single-bot adapters, `<channel_type>:<account_id>` for multi-bot adapters, account-qualified key tried first to match `router::resolve_with_context`'s precedence), looks up `router.channel_default(&key)`, and only calls `adapter.send()` when the bound agent equals the requesting agent's parsed UUID. Adapters with no router binding (`channel_default` returns `None`) are suppressed rather than fanned out — pre-fix code would have broadcast to them, post-fix the listener treats "no bound agent" as "cannot scope safely, drop". A malformed `approval.agent_id` (not a valid UUID) is also dropped with a WARN log rather than reverting to the pre-fix broadcast. Two trait-level additions support the scoping: new `ChannelAdapter::account_id() -> Option<&str>` (default `None`) exposes the multi-bot account identifier so the listener can build the same `telegram:<account_id>` key the router uses; `TelegramAdapter` overrides to return its configured `account_id`. Other adapters keep the default `None`, which means single-bot configurations fall through to the bare `<channel_type>` key as before — fully backward-compatible for the common case. Tests in `crates/librefang-channels/tests/bridge_integration_test.rs`: `test_approval_listener_scopes_delivery_to_requesting_agent_adapter` (two adapters bound to different agents via `telegram:bot-a` / `telegram:bot-b` keys, approval for agent A reaches only adapter A's recipient, adapter B's recipient receives nothing — the direct #4985 regression guard); `test_approval_listener_skips_unbound_adapter` (adapter with no `channel_default` entry is silently skipped instead of leaked to); `test_approval_listener_drops_malformed_agent_id` (non-UUID `agent_id` does not revert to broadcast). The two existing tests from #4881 were updated to register a router binding so the scoping check allows their happy path. `/approve` and `/reject` command dispatch is **not** chat-scoped in this PR — that's a separate concern noted in the issue body alongside #4905; tracked as out-of-scope follow-up. Two operator-visible narrowings land with this fix and are tracked as follow-ups: (a) adapters configured purely for `AgentBinding`-based routing with no `default_agent` (and so no `channel_defaults` entry) no longer receive approval notifications — the listener now treats "no bound agent on the channel key" as "cannot scope safely, drop" rather than fanning out. Binding-aware lookup is the proper fix and lands separately as a follow-up issue against this PR. (b) only `TelegramAdapter` currently overrides `account_id()`, so multi-bot deployments on Slack / Discord / Matrix / Mattermost / WeChat / Signal still resolve under the bare `<channel_type>` key and continue to share a single channel-default binding across bots; the per-adapter `account_id()` override is a small follow-up per adapter and is tracked separately. PR #4994 follow-up tightens two regressions found in review: (i) the qualified-key lookup no longer falls back to the bare key for adapters with `account_id().is_some()` — in mixed configs (one single-bot adapter + one multi-bot adapter on the same channel type) the bare-key fallback would have leaked an approval into the multi-bot adapter when its requesting agent matched the single-bot adapter's default; (ii) a malformed `approval.agent_id` (non-UUID) is now logged at ERROR rather than WARN so a misconfigured `require_approval` caller silently swallowing every approval surfaces in operator logs. No migration needed; the fix is purely defensive narrowing. Closes #4985. (@houko)

- **`save_session_summary` now produces real summaries via the auxiliary LLM** (#4869). On `reset_session` / `/new`, the kernel writes a summary of the about-to-be-deleted session to `kv_store`. Three independent defects compounded into a near-useless on-reset write: (1) the implementation looked at only the **last 10 messages**, so any non-trivial session was summarised from its closing pleasantries ("thanks", "sure", "you too"); (2) the filter accepted only `MessageContent::Text` user messages, so a session that ended on a tool-result turn produced **no summary at all** — the function early-returned on `topics.is_empty()` before writing anything (this is the silent vector for "some `/new`-deleted sessions on a heavy agent have no `session_*` kv_store entry"); (3) the storage key was `session_{date}_{slug}` where the slug came from the first user message's first 6 words, so two sessions on the same day whose first user turn slugged identically — easy with one-word openings like "Thanks", "Sure", "OK", "Yes" — silently overwrote each other. The reporter's 186-message vault-operator meal-planning session ("96 user + 90 assistant turns doing 6+ hours of work") got summarised as `session_2026-05-10_thanks → Key exchanges: 1. Thanks / 2. Sure / 3. You too`. New `AuxTask::SessionSummary` variant routes through `[llm.auxiliary]` like the workshop reviewer (default chain: openrouter-haiku → anthropic-haiku → openai gpt-4o-mini, same shape as `Compression` / `Fold` / `SkillWorkshopReview`). `save_session_summary` now clones the session messages, spawns a `tokio` task, calls `AuxClient::resolve(SessionSummary)`, and feeds the **entire** rendered transcript (text + `tool_use` + `tool_result` + `thinking` blocks, capped at 48k chars with the head dropped first so recent context survives) to the cheap-tier driver with a "5–10 bullets covering goal / work / files / decisions / final state" instruction. The 30s wall-clock timeout means a slow path doesn't keep the spawned task alive; failures log WARN and fall back to a trivial digest (turn counts, tool activity, first/last user goal) instead of producing nothing. **Same WARN-and-degrade behaviour when no aux chain resolves** — matches the `SkillWorkshopReview` precedent (no billing of the operator's primary provider on a side task); operators see a visible degraded-mode signal instead of silent quality loss. Storage key changed from `session_{date}_{slug}` to `session_{session_id}` — collision-free across same-day sessions because session IDs are unique by construction; also writes `{workspace}/memory/session-{session_id}.md` for human browsing when the workspace exists. The output is capped at 16 KiB (truncated on a UTF-8 boundary) so a misbehaving aux model can't write runaway content to disk or DB. The spawned task pre-clones everything it needs (messages, agent name, workspace path, substrate `Arc`) so it survives the immediate session deletion in `reset_session`. When no tokio runtime is available (non-async caller), the trivial digest is written synchronously — preserving on-reset behaviour without panicking. Tests: 4 in `librefang-kernel::kernel::session_ops::session_summary_tests` covering the previously silent failures (`trivial_summary_survives_tool_result_only_tail` pins the fix for defect 2 — a session ending mid-tool-loop now produces output; `trivial_summary_reports_turn_counts` pins the digest shape; `render_transcript_includes_tool_calls` confirms tool activity reaches the prompt — defect 2's root cause; `render_transcript_truncates_head_preserves_tail` pins the 48k-char cap behaviour). Closes #4869. (@houko)

- **`[budget]` config edits via dashboard now persist and take effect without restart** (#4797 / #4864). Three stacked regressions made `[budget]` look broken from every angle: (1) `GET /api/budget` returns the kernel-side `BudgetStatus` shape (`hourly_limit` / `daily_limit` / `monthly_limit` / `*_spend` / `*_pct`) but `dashboard/src/api.ts::BudgetStatus` and `AnalyticsPage` read `max_hourly_usd` / `max_daily_usd` / `max_monthly_usd` — a typed-shape mismatch that always rendered `-` for the operator's configured caps; the TypeScript interface and the AnalyticsPage cap row now match the wire shape, and dashboard reads include the `*_spend` / `*_pct` rollups computed against the live `usage_events` table. (2) `PUT /api/budget` previously called `kernel.update_budget_config` which only flipped the in-memory `BudgetConfig` ArcSwap (the route comment explicitly said "not persisted to config.toml") — a daemon restart silently dropped the operator's edit. The handler now merges body fields onto the live snapshot, validates each cap at the boundary (NaN / infinity / negative values / non-numeric types → 400 with the offending field named; `null` is treated as "no change"; canonical name wins over alias when both appear), rewrites the `[budget]` table in `config.toml` via `toml_edit` (preserving comments and unrelated sections like `[default_model]` / `[mcp_servers]` / `[[users]]`), backs up `config.toml.prev`, atomic-writes the new content, and calls `reload_config()` so the new caps reach the metering subsystem on the next LLM call. Failed persists are also audited with the attempted diff so forensics can see what an operator tried to set even when the kernel rejected it. (3) Editing `[budget]` directly in `config.toml` only took effect on restart because `MeteringSubsystem.budget_config` is initialised once at boot from `KernelConfig.budget` and the reload-plan diff never emitted a matching `HotAction` — `POST /api/config/reload` updated `self.config` but left the metering ArcSwap pointed at the stale snapshot. New `HotAction::UpdateBudget` variant + `apply_hot_actions_inner` arm that RCUs the new budget into `MeteringSubsystem`. The `Token quota exceeded` follow-on symptom in the bug report is the budget gate firing correctly once a non-zero cap is in effect; with the persistence + reload paths fixed, operators can now actually see and adjust the limits that drive that gate. Test coverage: 11 new integration tests in `budget_routes_test.rs` (`budget_put_persists_to_config_toml` reads the file directly to prove disk write happened, `budget_put_accepts_get_shape_aliases` pins read-modify-write contract, `budget_put_canonical_name_wins_over_alias` pins precedence, `budget_put_rejection_does_not_persist` pins byte-identical config.toml after 400, `budget_put_treats_null_as_no_change` pins null semantics, plus six rejection cases for negative/NaN/non-numeric/alias/token/threshold inputs) + `test_budget_hot_reload_emits_update_action` regression in `config_reload::tests` pinning `[budget]` diff → `HotAction::UpdateBudget`. Closes #4797. (@houko)
- **`provider = "ollama"` speaks the native Ollama protocol instead of the OpenAI-compat shim** (#4810). The registry shipped `ollama` with `api_format = OpenAI` and `base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"`, so every turn POSTed to `/v1/chat/completions`. Real Ollama supports that endpoint, but Ollama-protocol-only servers (AMD's Lemonade, certain llama.cpp wrappers, gpt4all variants) implement only `/api/chat` and 404'd on every request — see the original report's `lemond[2918]: 2026-05-08 23:29:51.528 [Error] (Server) Error 404: POST /v1/chat/completions`. Adds a new native `ApiFormat::Ollama` variant + `drivers::ollama::OllamaDriver` that POSTs to `{base_url}/api/chat` with the native body shape (`messages`, `tools`, `format`, `options.{temperature,num_predict}`, first-class `think: bool`) and parses NDJSON streaming with incremental `content` / `thinking` deltas plus a final `done: true` envelope carrying `prompt_eval_count` / `eval_count`. Tool calls land via `message.tool_calls[].function.{name, arguments(object)}` with synthesised `ollama-call-<uuid>` IDs since the native protocol doesn't return one; the round-trip on tool results uses `role: "tool"` + `tool_name` (Ollama's correlation key) rather than the OpenAI `tool_call_id`. Multi-modal images attach via `message.images: ["<base64>"]` instead of OpenAI's `image_url` envelope. The `think` field is **always sent** (driven by `request.thinking.is_some()`), preserving the legacy OpenAI-shim contract exactly — reasoning models like qwen3 / deepseek-r1 / gpt-oss default `think: true` upstream, so omitting the field would have silently flipped chain-of-thought on for users who never enabled the dashboard's deep-thinking toggle. `OllamaDriver::sanitize_base_url` silently strips a trailing `/v1` from existing user configs (with an INFO log) so the upgrade is non-breaking — pre-#4810 setups pinning `http://host:11434/v1` keep working — but the strip is gated on `/v1` being the *entire* path component, so reverse-proxy mounts like `http://api.corp.com/openai/v1` or `http://api.corp.com/api/v1` are left verbatim (stripping those would either compose a still-wrong `…/openai/api/chat` or mask a misconfiguration the user needs to see). Switching to the native protocol also lets us delete the `OpenAIDriver::is_ollama_like` substring detector and the `extra_body.think` injection hack — `think` is now a first-class request field on the only driver that consumes it. The `[provider_urls]` `set_provider_url` route and the `/api/providers/.../test` connectivity probe both branch on `ApiFormat::Ollama` so paste flows like `http://192.168.1.10:11434` no longer get a spurious `/v1` appended and the probe hits `/api/tags` instead of `/v1/models`. Streaming `tool_calls` chunks that fail to deserialise (protocol drift, malformed local-model output) emit a debug log and keep the prior snapshot rather than silently clearing it; truncated NDJSON (no final `done: true`) returns the partial response with zero token usage so callers can detect "incomplete" without a hard error. New integration suite `tests/ollama_driver.rs` covers request shape, native think, tool-call parsing & ID synthesis, NDJSON streaming aggregation, first-class thinking deltas, streaming tool-call event pairs, error mapping (404→ModelNotFound, 401→AuthenticationFailed, 502→Api), multi-modal image serialisation, `role:"tool"` round-trip, the legacy `/v1` migration, reverse-proxy `/v1` paths preserved verbatim, stringified tool-call argument coercion, malformed `tool_calls` chunks keeping prior snapshot, and truncated streams returning partial output with zero usage. Closes #4810. (@houko)
- **MCP OAuth: accept `token_endpoint` on the same registrable domain as the authorization server** (#4665). The strict #3713 host pin refused legitimate cross-domain OAuth-proxy patterns where a vendor's MCP service delegates token exchange to its main OAuth domain — Slack's `mcp.slack.com` advertises a `token_endpoint` on `slack.com/api/oauth.v2.user.access`, and the pin left users with no workaround. `token_endpoint_host_matches` in `routes/mcp_auth.rs` now accepts either an exact host match (preserves the #3713 pin) or hosts on the same eTLD+1 computed via the Public Suffix List (`psl` crate, compile-time-baked data). Multi-label public suffixes (`*.co.uk`, …) and PSL private domains (`*.github.io`, `*.s3.amazonaws.com`, …) are handled correctly so cross-tenant lookalikes don't false-match. IP literals (v4 + v6, including bracketed IPv6) only ever pass via exact match — `psl::domain_str("10.0.0.1")` returns `Some("0.1")` under the unknown-TLD default rule, so an explicit `is_ip_literal` short-circuit guards the eTLD+1 path. Threat trade-off documented inline on the helper: loosening admits an attacker who controls *any* sibling subdomain on the issuer's registrable domain to redirect the token exchange there *if they also* tamper with HTTPS-validated discovery metadata; accepted because the strict pin left no escape hatch and sibling-subdomain takeover within an org's own domain implies the org itself is compromised. Eight unit tests pin every acceptance and rejection path (cross-org, sibling subdomain accept, multi-label PSL, IPv4/IPv6 literals, IPv4 with shared trailing labels, mixed IP-vs-domain, PSL private-domain false-match guard).

- **Dashboard-saved provider keys survive `librefang` daemon restart** (#4701). `POST /api/providers/{name}/key` (`routes/providers.rs::set_provider_key`) writes the key to `<home>/secrets.env` and `set_var`s the live process so the in-memory driver picks it up — the running daemon works, but the next restart booted a process that had never seen the key. Reason: the user-mode systemd unit produced by `librefang service install` (`librefang-cli/src/main.rs::service_install_linux`) and the packaged `deploy/librefang.service` both reference `<home>/env` (or `/etc/librefang/env`) for `EnvironmentFile=`, not `secrets.env`, and nothing in the boot path re-read `secrets.env`. Fix is two layers. (1) New `librefang-api::secrets_env` module exposes `load_into_process_blocking(home)` (sync, called from `cmd_start` *before* the tokio runtime / kernel boot — the only window where `std::env::set_var` is sound) and `load_into_process_async(home)` (spawn-blocking-guarded variant for the existing `channel_bridge::reload_channels_from_disk` hot-reload path, which previously inlined the same parser and now delegates here so the two paths cannot drift). The CLI `cmd_start` now calls the sync loader between `daemon_config_context()` and the runtime build, so any restart route — `systemctl restart`, `librefang restart`, plain `librefang start` — picks up the dashboard-saved key. (2) Belt-and-braces: both unit templates now declare `EnvironmentFile=-<home>/secrets.env` alongside the existing `…/env` so a future systemd-only restart path (skipping the in-process loader) still gets the key, and so newly installed users do not need to know the file exists. Existing installs pick up the loader on the first restart after upgrading; the unit edit only matters for fresh installs and for restarts that bypass the LibreFang CLI. Acceptance test in `secrets_env::tests::load_into_process_blocking_populates_std_env` writes a UUID-tagged `secrets.env` into a `tempdir`, calls the loader, and asserts the resulting `std::env` state matches the file. Closes #4701. (@houko)
- **Workflow runs no longer disappear on graceful daemon shutdown** (#3335). `LibreFangKernel::shutdown` now invokes a new `WorkflowEngine::drain_on_shutdown` once, after `supervisor.shutdown()`, which transitions every `Running` / `Pending` run to `Paused` with a fresh `resume_token` and reason `"Interrupted by daemon shutdown"` and then flushes `workflow_runs.json` via the existing tmp+rename writer. Pre-fix, `persist_runs` deliberately skipped Running and Pending (no durable rollforward boundary), so a `librefang stop` with three in-flight runs left only the unrelated Completed row on disk and the dashboard came back up empty. Post-fix the operator can see the in-flight workload after restart and resume it via the existing `resume_run` API; the stale-running-runs sweep at next boot remains the safety net for crash paths where the drain never executed. Crash shutdown (SIGKILL / OOM / power loss) is **not** changed by this PR — that is what `recover_stale_running_runs` already handles. (@houko)
- **CI Test job red on main for ~30 runs: align 5 missed assertions with dual-shape error envelope (#3639 / #4655 follow-up)**. `Test / macOS|Windows|Ubuntu (shard 2/3/4)` had been failing on the same five integration tests since the #3639 envelope migration: `plugins_routes_integration::install_plugin_rejects_missing_source` / `install_plugin_registry_source_requires_name` / `plugin_registry_search_rejects_invalid_registry_param` and `totp_flow_test::confirm_rejects_replayed_code` / `setup_when_already_confirmed_requires_current_code`. The cause is a shape mismatch — `/api/plugins/install` is `Idempotency-Key`-wrapped (#3637) so its inner handler still emits the flat `{error: <string>, code, type}` envelope, `/api/plugins/registry/search` returns the bare `ApiErrorResponse::bad_request()` shape `{error: <string>}`, while sibling routes use the standardized nested `{error: {message, ...}}` shape (#3639). PR #4655's first alignment pass committed the nested-only assertion at these five sites, so they read `body["error"]["message"]` and saw `Value::Null` when production returned flat. Switched to the dual-shape pattern `body["error"].as_str().or_else(|| body["error"]["message"].as_str())` consistent with the rest of `totp_flow_test.rs:340`, so the assertions pass on whichever envelope each route emits and survive future inner refactors. The `OpenAPI Drift` job (also red on `ee8ee554`) self-healed on the next push via the `IS_INTERNAL_PR` auto-commit branch in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — local `cargo xtask codegen --openapi` + `python3 scripts/codegen-sdks.py` + `cargo xtask schema-check gen` are now no-ops on `origin/main`. (@houko)
- **Daemon log lines now carry `agent.id` / `session.id` for correlation across `run_agent_loop` and supervised background tasks.** Three changes: (1) `run_agent_loop`'s `#[instrument]` span sets `session.id` alongside `agent.id` AND is pinned to `level = "warn"` so the daemon's baseline filter `librefang_runtime=warn` (installed by `init_tracing_stderr` to suppress runtime INFO noise) does not drop the span before it is created — INFO-level spans are filtered at the registry layer regardless of whether downstream events are visible, so every WARN/ERROR event inside the loop was firing in a bare context; the level bump is invisible to operators because `#[instrument]` does not auto-emit on enter/exit; (2) `librefang_kernel::supervised_spawn` now wraps the spawned future with `.instrument(Span::current())` — `tokio::spawn` does NOT propagate the current tracing span, so every supervised background task (channel bridges, cron tickers, inbox pumps, persist loops; ~48 call sites in the kernel) was starting in a bare span context; (3) `run_agent_loop_streaming` picks up the same `level = "warn"` + `session.id` field for parity. Symptom before: `docker logs jarvis | grep "Shell exec"` showed no agent context. After: `WARN run_agent_loop{agent.name=… agent.id="…" session.id="…"}: shell exec full mode …`. New regression tests: `instrument_span_fields::warn_inside_agent_span_includes_agent_and_session_ids`, `info_span_is_dropped_under_warn_target_filter` (proves the original bug), and `warn_span_survives_warn_target_filter_and_carries_fields` (pins the fix) in runtime; `with_trace_id_compact_format_carries_agent_and_session_ids_from_span` in cli; `supervised_spawn::tests::supervised_task_inherits_caller_span` in kernel. (@vigneshjagadeesh)
- **`DELETE /api/agents/{id}` idempotent on nonexistent agent** — #4630 introduced a `?confirm=true` data-loss gate that fired UNCONDITIONALLY before the registry lookup, so even a DELETE for an already-absent agent returned 409 `delete_confirmation_required` instead of the documented idempotent 200. The handler now reorders: registry check first → 200 idempotent on absent → 409 confirm-required only when the agent actually exists → 409 hand-owned guard preserved. Restores the `test_delete_nonexistent_agent_is_idempotent` invariant in `librefang-testing`. Refs #4614 / #4630. (@houko)
- **Review follow-ups for #4640 / #4649 / #4651 / #4655** (batch 1). (1) CI `Test / Unit (lib+bin)` job: added `--no-tests=pass` to the full-run `cargo nextest` invocation so workspace crates with zero lib/bin tests (pure type-def crates) no longer exit 4 and fail the job. (2) `librefang-skills` supply-chain audit: `.pth` extension check is now case-insensitive (`eq_ignore_ascii_case`) catching `evil.PTH` / `evil.Pth` on macOS/Windows; `collect_recursive` switched from `path.is_dir()` (follows symlinks) to `entry.file_type().is_dir()` (does not follow), and any symlink in the bundle now produces a `symlink-escape` `Violation` that blocks the install. (3) `librefang-runtime` artifact store: `spill_threshold_bytes` and `max_artifact_bytes` wired from `ToolResultsConfig` through `ToolExecContext` into `tool_web_fetch_legacy` (previously hardcoded `16_384`); new `max_artifact_bytes` field added to `ToolResultsConfig` (default 64 MiB) and enforced in `artifact_store::write` so oversized payloads fall back to truncation; Windows rename TOCTOU fixed by using unique temp names (`{hash}.{pid}.{nanos}.tmp`) and treating a post-rename `dest.exists()` as an idempotent success. (4) `librefang-api` tests: two `body["error"]["message"].as_str()` flat-only assertions in `memory_routes_integration.rs` (bulk-delete and put-blank-content error paths) converted to the dual-shape pattern consistent with the rest of the file. (@houko)

- **`librefang-cli` TUI compile break + two missed early-exit progress sites** (#4654 / #4647 follow-up). PR #4654 changed `LibreFangKernel::mcp_catalog()` from `RwLock<McpCatalog>` to `ArcSwap<McpCatalog>` but missed `crates/librefang-cli/src/tui/event.rs:2596` which still called `.read().unwrap_or_else(...)` — `librefang-cli` failed to compile in any build that touched the TUI module (the `cargo check --workspace --lib` run in #4654 missed this because the binary entry isn't a `--lib` target). Migrated to the new `mcp_catalog_load()` snapshot. Also picks up the two `cmd_init_upgrade` early-exit paths (`Failed to create backups dir`, `Failed to backup config`) that PR #4647 missed — they were upstream of the four paths fixed there and still dropped the spinner without `finish()`. (@houko)
- **CLI `progress.rs` early-exit hygiene + failure-finish glyph** (#3306 follow-up). Three `cmd_init_upgrade` error paths called `std::process::exit(1)` while the progress bar was still active, leaving the TTY cursor hidden / spinner half-drawn — they now `finish()` first. New `ProgressReporter::finish_with_failure(msg)` method (with default impl delegating to `finish` for back-compat) is wired through `Spinner` / `ProgressBar` / `LogReporter`; `cmd_skill_install`, `cmd_skill_publish`, and `cmd_migrate` Err arms now use it so failure messages render with a distinct glyph instead of looking identical to success. `auto()` selection logic refactored into a pure `pick_reporter_kind(is_stderr_tty, total)` helper with explicit unit-test coverage. (#3306 follow-up) (@houko)
- **Centralised `KernelOpError → ApiErrorResponse` mapping** for the #3541 typed-errors series. The 7 stacked PRs (#4608–#4619) shipped per-route ad-hoc matches that drifted: `approvals.rs` mapped *every* `KernelOpError` to 404 (so an `Unavailable` "approval system disabled" surfaced as 404 instead of 503); `prompts.rs` mapped *every* error to 500 (so `NotFound { kind: "prompt_version" }` collapsed to 500 instead of 404); `task_queue.rs::map_kernel_op_err` mapped `Unavailable` to 500 instead of the documented 503; `workflows.rs::create_cron_job` mapped `Unavailable` to 500 and `Other` to 400. New `impl From<KernelOpError> for ApiErrorResponse` in `librefang-api/src/error.rs` is now the single source of truth (`NotFound→404, Invalid→400, Unavailable→503, Serialize/Other→500`); all four routes delegate to it. Adds machine-readable `code: not_found / invalid_input / service_unavailable / serialize_failed / internal_error`. (#3541 follow-up) (@houko)
- **Replace the `agents.rs` `format!("{e}").contains("Agent not found")` substring grep** with a structural match on the `KernelError::LibreFang(LibreFangError::AgentNotFound | QuotaExceeded)` variants in the `send_message` handler — eliminating the typed-grep that the #3541 series claimed to retire but missed at this hot-path call site. The session-mismatch branch still flows through `LibreFangError::Internal(_)` at the kernel side and remains a substring check scoped to that variant; eliminating that last grep needs a kernel emit-site refactor to a typed `SessionAgentMismatch` variant, tracked as a separate follow-up. (#3541 follow-up) (@houko)
- **`PromptStore` kernel impl: classify input-validation failures as `Invalid { field, reason }`** instead of `Other(format!("Invalid X ID: …"))`. Affects `agent_id`, `experiment_id`, `variant_id`, and `version_id` parse failures across `get_running_experiment`, `record_experiment_request`, `get_prompt_version`, `delete_prompt_version`, `set_active_prompt_version`, `get_experiment`, `update_experiment_status`, and `get_experiment_metrics`. Combined with the new central mapping above, malformed IDs now surface as 400 instead of 500. The `"Prompt store not initialized"` `ok_or` arms migrated to `KernelOpError::unavailable("Prompt store")` (503) so callers can distinguish "feature wired off" from generic 500. Closes the explicit follow-up debt acknowledged in the #3541 6/N CHANGELOG entry. (#3541 follow-up) (@houko)
- **`idempotency_test` filter to exclude the auto-spawned `assistant`** when asserting `agent_registry().list().len()`. The 3 failing tests (`spawn_with_idempotency_key_replays_response`, `spawn_with_reused_key_different_body_is_409`, `spawn_without_idempotency_key_is_unchanged`) were main-red since they merged in #4565 because `LibreFangKernel::boot_with_config` auto-creates a default `assistant` agent on a fresh registry — the assertions assumed an empty registry. New `test_spawned_agents` helper filters the bootstrap agent so each test counts only the agents it explicitly created. Test-only change; no production behaviour shift. (@houko)
- **`session_repair::tests::prop::validate_and_repair_no_orphans_no_dup_results` proptest invariant 3 refined** to match the actual repair-pipeline contract. The original "no duplicate ToolResult tool_use_ids in the output" was structurally inconsistent with the explicit `reorder_preserves_per_turn_synthetic_when_tool_id_collides_across_turns` regression test, which deliberately requires both ToolResults to survive when a ToolUse id is reused across multiple assistant turns (Moonshot/Kimi per-completion-counter pattern, e.g. `memory_store:6` reset per call). The proptest now mirrors `deduplicate_tool_results`'s `collision_ids` logic: ids that appear in >1 assistant turn are positional duplicates by design and skip the uniqueness check; everything else is still required to be unique. Test-only change; no production behaviour shift. Fixes the fourth main-red CI failure that has been blocking the #3541 stack from going green. (@houko)
- Matrix adapter: inbound `m.file` / `m.image` / `m.audio` / `m.video` events were silently surfaced as `ChannelContent::Text(filename)` — agents never saw the attachment bytes. Fixed by branching on `content.msgtype` and resolving `mxc://` to an HTTPS download URL the bridge layer can stage. (@neo-wanderer)

- **`librefang-memory-wiki` crate — durable markdown knowledge vault with provenance and Obsidian-friendly export** (#3329, v1 isolated mode). Pairs with the existing SQLite/vector substrate: where memory answers "find me the K nearest snippets", the wiki answers "give me a navigable knowledge base I can also open in Obsidian and edit by hand". Every page lives at `<vault>/<topic>.md` with YAML frontmatter (`topic`, `created`, `updated`, `content_sha256`, append-only `provenance: [{agent, session, channel, turn, at}]`); cross-references use `[[topic]]` placeholders that the vault rewrites per its `render_mode` (`native` → `[topic](topic.md)`, `obsidian` → `[[topic]]`). The compiler maintains a deterministic `index.md` plus `_meta/backlinks.json`, and refuses to silently overwrite a page whose on-disk **mtime or sha256** has drifted since the last write — the caller gets `WikiError::HandEditConflict` and must pass `force = true` to merge, in which case the human edit is preserved verbatim and only provenance is appended (the vault never drops a hand-edited line). Three new builtin tools: `wiki_get(topic)`, `wiki_search(query, limit?)`, and `wiki_write(topic, body, force?)` — provenance is constructed kernel-side from the calling agent so the LLM cannot spoof it. **Off by default**: a new `[memory_wiki]` config block (`enabled = false`, `mode = "isolated"|"bridge"|"unsafe_local"`, `vault_path`, `render_mode`, `ingest_filter`) gates construction; with the default config the wiki tools return `KernelOpError::unavailable("wiki")` and zero filesystem state is created. Reserved modes (`bridge` / `unsafe_local`) and the `memory_search corpus = all|kv|wiki` extension surface a typed not-yet-implemented error and are tracked as #3329 follow-ups; v1 ingests via explicit `wiki_write` rather than subscribing to memory events. New `WikiAccess` role trait on `KernelHandle` follows the #3746 split — default impls return `unavailable` so existing kernel stubs and mocks compile unchanged. Integration coverage in `crates/librefang-memory-wiki/tests/wiki_acceptance.rs` mirrors the seven-bullet acceptance list in the issue. Runbook to enable: set `enabled = true`, choose `render_mode`, pick a writable `vault_path`, and call `wiki_write` from any agent — the page lands at `<vault>/<topic>.md` with provenance frontmatter and shows up in `index.md` and `_meta/backlinks.json` on the next write. (@houko)
- **Tool-result context budget — cumulative cap + history fold + artifact GC + primary-fetch spill** (#3347). Closes #3347 by landing the four remaining mechanisms (mechanism 1 artifact spill landed via #4651, but only on the legacy plain-HTTP path). (1) `[runtime.tool_results] max_bytes_per_turn` (default 50 KB) is now active: when a single assistant turn's accumulated tool-result bytes would exceed the cap, the next result escalates to artifact spill (or tail truncation if spill fails); resets between turns. (2) `[runtime.tool_results] history_fold_after_turns` (default 8) is now active: tool-result messages older than N assistant turns have each `ContentBlock::ToolResult.content` rewritten in place to a compact `[history-fold] <summary>` stub (via the aux-LLM channel), preserving `tool_use_id` / `tool_name` / `is_error` / `status` so every assistant `tool_use` block keeps its matching answer — provider APIs (Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, Gemini function_call) reject mismatched ids with `400 invalid_request_error`, so the earlier draft that replaced messages with free-form text would have broken the next provider call. Falls back to `[history-fold] [summarisation unavailable]` (per-block) when no aux-LLM is configured or the call fails, so stale payload is always removed. Pinned messages are never folded. New `[runtime.tool_results] fold_min_batch_size` (default 4) caps aux-LLM cost on long sessions: skips the fold pass until at least N newly-stale messages have accumulated, instead of paying one round-trip per turn just to fold a single just-stale message. (3) `[runtime.tool_results] artifact_max_age_days` (default 30; `0` disables) drives a startup-time artifact-store GC that walks `~/.librefang/data/artifacts/` once per daemon boot and evicts `<hash>.bin` files (and orphan `<hash>.<pid>.<nanos>.tmp` writers) older than the threshold; clock-skew futures are clamped to age zero. (4) Artifact spill now also wraps the primary `WebToolsContext::fetch` path (Tavily / Brave / Jina / SSRF-protected GET) and `web_search` (multi-provider + DDG fallback) — #4651 only wired the legacy plain-HTTP fallback, so large readability-converted payloads on the main paths were still inlined; both paths now share a single `spill_or_passthrough` helper that falls through to the original body on write failure. (5) Layer 2 (per-result) and Layer 3 (per-turn cumulative) spill route through `crate::artifact_store::maybe_spill` — the same content-addressed `~/.librefang/data/artifacts/<sha256>.bin` directory the web tools and `read_artifact` already use. The earlier draft sent Layer 2/3 to a parallel `/tmp/librefang-results/<id>.txt` directory; that path was outside both `read_artifact` (which only accepts `sha256:<hex>` handles) and the artifact-store GC's `.bin`/`.tmp` allowlist, so spilled data was unreachable from the LLM and the temp directory grew unbounded on macOS / Windows. Stub format unified to `[tool_result: <name> | sha256:... | N bytes | preview:]` so the LLM sees one shape regardless of which layer triggered the spill, and can fetch the original via `read_artifact(handle, offset, length)`. Closes #3347. (@houko)
- Incognito chat mode (`incognito: true` on message body / `--incognito` on CLI). Session-message persistence (every `save_session_async` call site in the agent loop) and proactive-memory writes via the `memory_store` tool are dropped silently — the LLM still sees a synthetic `"ok"` tool result so it does not retry. Memory reads remain full-access throughout the turn. Audit-log entries for tool calls are preserved (operator visibility unchanged). Closes #4073. (@houko)
- Wire `progress::auto()` into `cmd_skill_install`, `cmd_skill_publish`, `cmd_migrate`, and `cmd_init_upgrade`; TTY gets animated bar/spinner, non-TTY falls back to plain log lines. (#3306) (@houko)
- Surface caller agent / session / step IDs as `x-librefang-{agent,session,step}-id` headers on outbound OpenAI-compatible requests, so observability sidecars in front of the upstream provider can correlate request log records without parsing the JSON body. New `session_id` and `step_id` fields on `CompletionRequest` (sibling to the existing `agent_id`); both `Option<String>`, omitted from the wire when `None` or empty. Header values are validated via `reqwest::header::HeaderValue::from_str` and silently skipped (with a `warn!`) on parse failure so a malformed trace ID never fails the LLM call. Other drivers (Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Vertex, ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code) accept the new fields but do not yet emit headers; per-driver header emission is a follow-up that will reuse the same opt-out flag. The `x-` prefix is intentionally retained over RFC 6648's "prefer unprefixed" guidance — see `build_custom_header_map` doc-comment for the rationale (industry de-facto convention, internal precedent in `claude_code.rs`'s `X-LibreFang-Agent-Id`, RFC 6648 is non-normative BCP guidance for new protocols). (#4548) (@neo-wanderer)
- **Operator opt-out for trace headers** via new `[telemetry] emit_caller_trace_headers = true` config field (default `true`). Set to `false` in `config.toml` to suppress all three `x-librefang-*` headers wire-side regardless of whether `CompletionRequest`'s caller-id fields are populated. Targets operators with strict zero-egress policies (regulated tenants, EU healthcare, audit-sensitive deployments) who want no LibreFang-internal identifiers — even opaque UUIDs — crossing the upstream-provider boundary. The flag is plumbed through `DriverConfig.emit_caller_trace_headers` to `OpenAIDriver::with_emit_caller_trace_headers(...)` at driver-creation time. (#4548) (@neo-wanderer)
- **Wire-shape change for `extra_headers` on the OpenAI-compatible driver**: the driver now applies `extra_headers` via `RequestBuilder::headers(map)` (replace-on-same-name) instead of a per-entry `req_builder.header(...)` loop (append-on-same-name). Operators relying on the old append-and-keep-both behaviour for a header that ALSO appeared as a default elsewhere on the request builder (e.g. `Authorization`) will see one value on the wire instead of two — almost certainly the more useful behaviour, but worth flagging in release notes. Distinct-name entries are unaffected (still appended, still preserved). (#4548) (@neo-wanderer)
- **`agent_id` / `session_id` structured fields on HTTP access log** — the `request_logging` middleware now reads `AgentIdField` and `SessionIdField` markers from `Response::extensions` after `next.run().await` and emits `agent_id=<uuid>` and `session_id=<uuid>` on every access-log line (all four severity levels). Handlers that already parse these identifiers call the existing `with_agent_id` helper or the new `with_session_id` / composed `with_session_id(sid, with_agent_id(aid, body))` form. Three representative handlers updated as samples: `get_agent_session`, `send_message`, and `attach_session_stream`. Without this, tracing all requests for a specific agent or session required `RUST_LOG=debug` and substring-matching raw URI paths whose `{id}` segments are collapsed by the metrics normaliser. Closes #3511. (@houko)
- **`AppState.bridge_manager` migrated from `tokio::sync::Mutex<Option<BridgeManager>>` to `arc_swap::ArcSwap<Option<BridgeManager>>`** (#3747). Hot-reload reads are now lock-free atomic loads; the stop/swap path uses `ArcSwap::swap` + `Arc::try_unwrap` to obtain owned access for `BridgeManager::stop()`. `arc-swap` is already a workspace dependency (used by `librefang-kernel`); the `librefang-api` and `librefang-testing` crates now declare it explicitly. The `prometheus_handle` field was already absent from `AppState` (parked in a module-level `OnceLock` in `crate::telemetry`); the `peer_registry` field was also already absent (all routes call `state.kernel.peer_registry_ref()` directly). No behaviour change. (@houko)
- `cargo xtask check-changed` — local mirror of the `changes` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Computes which CI lanes a branch's diff would trigger (rust / docs / ci / install / workspace_cargo / xtask_src), the `full_run` and `full_test` decisions, and the affected crate set (with the schema-mirror rule that pulls `librefang-api` in for any `librefang-types` change). `--json` for tooling, `--run check,clippy,test` actually invokes scoped cargo commands. (#3296) (@houko)
- **Tool-result artifact spill + `read_artifact` tool** (#3347 1/N). When a tool returns a payload larger than `spill_threshold_bytes` (default 16 KB), the runtime writes the raw bytes to `~/.librefang/data/artifacts/<sha256>.bin` atomically and replaces the agent's copy with a compact stub: tool name, handle, total size, and a 1 KB preview. Agents use the new built-in `read_artifact(handle, offset?, length?)` tool to retrieve content in up to 64 KB chunks. The `[tool_results]` config table exposes three knobs: `spill_threshold_bytes` (active), `max_bytes_per_turn` (deferred — cumulative budget, depends on aux-LLM channel #3314, tracked in #3347 2/N), and `history_fold_after_turns` (deferred — history fold, tracked in #3347 3/N). Spill writes are idempotent (same hash → no rewrite) and the fallback to byte-cap truncation is preserved on write failure. (#3347 1/N) (@houko)
- `?offset=&limit=` pagination on `GET /api/peers` and `GET /api/skills`. Both endpoints now accept the canonical `PaginationQuery` and return the existing `PaginatedResponse{items,total,offset,limit}` envelope (skills also keeps the `categories` field). Server caps `limit` at 100; requests asking for more are silently clamped. Backward-compatible — clients that omit both query params still receive the unbounded list (full collection). Reusable `crate::types::PaginationQuery` + `paginate()` helper introduced in `librefang-api/src/types.rs` for future endpoints to adopt. (#3639 1/N) (@houko)
- **Idempotency-Key on three additional state-creating POST endpoints** (#3637 2/N): `POST /api/hands/{hand_id}/activate`, `POST /api/plugins/install`, and `POST /api/webhooks` now honour the opt-in `Idempotency-Key` header using the same substrate introduced in #4565 (`idempotency_keys` SQLite table, migration v34, 24 h TTL). Same key + same body replays the cached 2xx; same key + different body returns 409 Conflict; non-2xx responses are not cached so transient failures remain retriable. The inbound-channel dedup mechanism `(channel, chat, update_id)` requires adding `librefang-memory` as a new dependency of `librefang-channels`, which is an architectural boundary change; that slice is deferred to a follow-up PR rather than half-finished here. (#3637 2/N) (@houko)
- Config-driven session mode for agent triggers (`session_mode = "new" | "persistent"`) — per-agent default with per-trigger override # pragma: no-attribution
- **Real-client-IP resolution for proxied deployments** via two new top-level config fields, `trusted_proxies` and `trust_forwarded_for`. When both are set and the TCP peer matches the allowlist, the GCRA + auth-login rate limiters and the WebSocket per-IP connection cap key on the IP from forwarding headers (`CF-Connecting-IP` → `X-Real-IP` → `Forwarded` (RFC 7239) → rightmost-untrusted hop in `X-Forwarded-For`) instead of the proxy's own address. Without both flags set, behaviour is unchanged: TCP peer only, headers ignored. Forged forwarding headers from peers outside the allowlist are still ignored, so a rotating `X-Forwarded-For` from the open internet can never bypass per-IP limits. Closes the long-standing TODO referenced in `rate_limiter::resolve_client_ip` (now retired). # pragma: no-attribution
- Fan out `x-librefang-{agent,session,step}-id` trace headers to Anthropic, Gemini, and ChatGPT (Responses API) drivers. Logic extracted into a shared `drivers/trace_headers.rs` module; each driver gains `with_emit_caller_trace_headers(bool)` builder (default `true`) wired through `DriverConfig.emit_caller_trace_headers` — same opt-out that shipped with OpenAI in #4548. Bedrock, Vertex, Copilot, and CLI-style drivers are follow-ups. (#4637 1/N) (@houko)
- Trace headers extended to Bedrock / Vertex AI / Copilot drivers (`x-librefang-{agent,session,step}-id`). Bedrock placement verified for SigV4 compatibility: this driver uses Bearer token auth (`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`), not SigV4 canonical signing, so trace headers are appended alongside `Authorization: Bearer` with no signing-scope concern. Vertex AI uses the same `build_trace_header_map` helper as Gemini with Google Cloud OAuth2 Bearer auth. Copilot forwards the flag to its inner `OpenAIDriver` via `make_inner_driver`. All three gain `with_emit_caller_trace_headers(bool)` builders wired through `DriverConfig.emit_caller_trace_headers`. CLI-style drivers (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code) use config-payload identifiers, not wire headers — deferred to a 3/N follow-up. (#4637 2/N) (@houko)
- Trace identifiers extended to CLI-style drivers (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code) via env vars `LIBREFANG_AGENT_ID`, `LIBREFANG_SESSION_ID`, and `LIBREFANG_STEP_ID` set on the spawned subprocess. These env vars do not reach the upstream provider's wire (the CLI manages its own auth and LLM transport) but let operators correlate OS process-tree entries with LibreFang agent sessions via sidecars or `ps`/`/proc` inspection. Claude Code preserves its existing `X-LibreFang-Agent-Id` header in the `--mcp-config` JSON payload for back-compat; the new env vars are additive. All four drivers gain `with_emit_caller_trace_headers(bool)` builders (default `true`) wired through `DriverConfig.emit_caller_trace_headers`. Closes #4637 (all 10 drivers covered: 1 OpenAI-wire via #4548, 3 HTTP-wire via #4644+#4653, 6 CLI via this PR). (#4637 3/N) (@houko)
- Matrix adapter: lifecycle reactions (`send_reaction`) with redact-on-replace state, thread replies (`send_in_thread` with `m.thread` relation + back-compat `is_falling_back`), streaming output (`send_streaming` with debounced `m.replace` edits, supports_streaming = true), inbound + outbound media (`m.image` / `m.file` / `m.audio` / `m.video` / voice marker), `DeleteMessage` via `m.redact`, `EditInteractive` via `m.replace`, `Location`, `Sticker` (text fallback), `MediaGroup` (sequential events). E2EE rooms emit a one-shot WARN per room. Match on `ChannelContent` is now exhaustive across all 18 variants. (@neo-wanderer)
- Matrix adapter: render `m.text` `body` together with `format: "org.matrix.custom.html"` + `formatted_body` (CommonMark → HTML via `pulldown-cmark`, GFM tables / strikethrough / task-lists enabled). Element / SchildiChat / Cinny now render bold, headings, lists, links, fenced code blocks, and tables that previously appeared as raw markdown. Applied to `api_send_message`, `api_edit_event` (both outer fallback and `m.new_content`), thread replies, and streaming placeholders / overflow tails. Raw `Event::Html` / `Event::InlineHtml` from the input are demoted to text so model-authored output cannot inject `<script>` / `<iframe>` / `<img onerror>` into rooms. (@neo-wanderer)

### Performance

- Swap kernel `model_catalog` from `RwLock<ModelCatalog>` to `ArcSwap<ModelCatalog>` so the hot `send_message_full` path reads the catalog atomically instead of taking 5+ read locks per request. Writers (key validation, provider probes, catalog sync) use the RCU pattern via a new `LibreFangKernel::model_catalog_update(|cat| …)` helper. `ModelCatalog` gains `#[derive(Clone)]` (cheap by ref-count of Vec/HashMap members; only happens on the rare write paths). Removes the lock contention between concurrent agent loops on multi-tenant deployments without changing behaviour. (#3384) (@houko)
- **`mcp_catalog` migrated from `RwLock` to `ArcSwap`** (matching the `model_catalog` pattern from #4599). All five catalog read sites in `routes/skills.rs` (`list_mcp_catalog`, `get_mcp_catalog_entry`, two extensions list/detail handlers, and the install-flow template lookup) switch from `mcp_catalog().read().unwrap_or_else(…)` to a lock-free `mcp_catalog_load()` snapshot load; hot-reload and `POST /api/mcp/reload` writers use `mcp_catalog_reload()` which builds a fresh `McpCatalog` and stores it atomically. `McpCatalog` gains `#[derive(Clone)]` (only `HashMap<String, McpCatalogEntry>` + `PathBuf` — cheap to clone, clone only happens on the infrequent reload path). The existing `budget_config` was already on `ArcSwap` (migrated in a prior PR). Sync `std::fs::read_to_string` inside `reload_agent_from_disk` (a sync fn called from async axum handlers) is now wrapped with `tokio::task::block_in_place` so the tokio worker thread is not parked during I/O. The remaining sync context-md read on the streaming entry path (`send_message_streaming_with_sender_and_opts`) is deferred — the async `load_context_md_async` is already used on all other call sites. Closes #3579. (@houko)

### Changed

- **Drop `LibreFangKernel` inherent forwards in favor of focused `*SubsystemApi` traits** (#3565 follow-up #4766). The 13 focused subsystem traits introduced in #4756 (`AgentSubsystemApi`, `EventSubsystemApi`, `GovernanceSubsystemApi`, `LlmSubsystemApi`, `McpSubsystemApi`, `MediaSubsystemApi`, `MemorySubsystemApi`, `MeshSubsystemApi`, `MeteringSubsystemApi`, `ProcessSubsystemApi`, `SecuritySubsystemApi`, `SkillsSubsystemApi`, `WorkflowSubsystemApi`) are now the canonical surface for subsystem access — re-exported at the crate root so external consumers can `use librefang_kernel::FooSubsystemApi` without reaching into the `kernel::subsystems` module. ~50 thin forwarding methods on `LibreFangKernel` (`audit`, `metering_ref`, `agent_registry`, `agent_identities`, `memory_substrate`, `proactive_memory_store`, `auth_manager`, `pairing_ref`, `approvals`, `hook_registry`, `event_bus_ref`, `injection_senders_ref`, `processes`, `process_registry`, `model_catalog_ref`, `model_catalog_load`, `clear_driver_cache`, `embedding`, `default_model_override_ref`, `mcp_catalog`, `mcp_catalog_load`, `mcp_health`, `mcp_connections_ref`, `mcp_auth_states_ref`, `oauth_provider_ref`, `mcp_tools_ref`, `effective_mcp_servers_ref`, `web_tools`, `browser`, `media`, `tts`, `media_drivers`, `a2a_tasks`, `a2a_agents`, `delivery`, `channel_adapters_ref`, `bindings_ref`, `broadcast_ref`, `peer_registry_ref`, `peer_node_ref`, `cron`, `workflow_engine`, `templates`, `trigger_engine`, `command_queue_ref`, `scheduler_ref`, `supervisor_ref`, `traces`, `skill_registry_ref`, `hands`, `budget_config`) deleted from `accessors.rs`. The `KernelApi` god-trait surface stays byte-identical — its method names route to the focused traits via fully-qualified `<Self as crate::FooSubsystemApi>::method(self)` syntax, so every `Arc<dyn KernelApi>` caller in `librefang-api` is unaffected. `Arc<LibreFangKernel>` / `&LibreFangKernel` callers (kernel internals, CLI TUI, desktop app, integration tests, ACP adapter) gain a one-line `use librefang_kernel::FooSubsystemApi` import per file. Inherents that genuinely cannot move to a trait stay put: `update_budget_config` / `model_catalog_update` (`impl Fn`/`impl FnMut` arguments), `mcp_catalog_reload` / `install_peer_registry_for_test` (direct field writes), `aux_client` (`ArcSwap::load_full` returns an owned `Arc`). Lays the groundwork for #3566 to carve `KernelApi` itself into focused trait objects. (@houko)

- **`librefang-api` narrows the concrete `LibreFangKernel` coupling** (#3744 N/N). Two new role traits added to `librefang-kernel-handle`: `ApiAuth` (5 methods — `auth_api_key`, `dashboard_raw_config`, `auth_home_dir`, `auth_device_api_keys`, `auth_config_users`) and `SessionWriter` (1 method — `inject_attachment_blocks`). Both are implemented on `LibreFangKernel` and included in the `KernelHandle` supertrait. Server-layer auth helpers (`dashboard_session_token`, `valid_api_tokens`, `has_dashboard_credentials`, `configured_user_api_keys`, `paired_device_user_keys`, `any_auth_configured`, `check_bind_auth_safety`) narrowed from `&LibreFangKernel` to `&dyn ApiAuth`. `inject_attachments_into_session` in `routes/agents.rs` narrowed from `&LibreFangKernel` to `&dyn SessionWriter` with the injection logic moved into the kernel impl. All test stubs in `librefang-runtime` (`ApprovalKernel`, `ForceHumanCapturingKernel`, `NamedWsKernel`, `SpawnCheckKernel` in `tool_runner.rs`; `CapturingKernel` in `tool_runner_forwarding.rs`, `tool_runner_agent_event.rs`, `tool_runner_forwarding_task_cron.rs`) implement the new `ApiAuth` and `SessionWriter` traits. The `AppState.kernel` field, `channel_bridge.rs` adapters, `routes/mod.rs`, and `routes/providers.rs` retain `Arc<LibreFangKernel>` — these sites call 100+ kernel-internal methods (config, model catalog, probe results) that cannot be feasibly abstracted without exceeding the 30-method cap; they are covered by the allowlist in `scripts/check-api-kernel-imports.sh`. The comment-strip regex in that script is tightened to catch trailing-comment forms. Closes #3744. (@houko)

- Deprecate flat error fields in favor of nested `error.code|message|request_id`; flat shape kept for one minor. `ApiErrorResponse` now serializes both the new nested `error` envelope and the legacy top-level `code` / `type` / `request_id` fields on every JSON 4xx/5xx response, and the dashboard parser prefers the nested shape with a fallback to the flat one. (#3639 deferred) (@houko)
- **`KernelHandle` role traits gain a typed `KernelOpError`** (#3541 1/N): `EventBus`, `KnowledgeGraph`, and `CronControl` migrated from `Result<_, String>` to `Result<_, librefang_kernel_handle::KernelOpError>`. The new enum has structured variants (`Unavailable { capability }`, `NotFound { kind, id }`, `Invalid { field, reason }`, `Serialize`, `Other(String)`) so callers can match on the cause instead of substring-grepping the formatted message. The catch-all `Other(String)` and `From<String>`/`From<&str>` impls keep the migration window cheap — un-classified kernel sites can opt in incrementally. The api workflow handler now maps `Unavailable` to HTTP 503 directly off the variant. Existing `Arc<dyn KernelHandle>` callers keep compiling unchanged via `KernelHandle`'s blanket impl. (#3541 1/N) (@houko)
- **`TaskQueue` role trait migrated to `KernelOpError`** (#3541 2/N): all 8 methods (`task_post`, `task_claim`, `task_complete`, `task_list`, `task_delete`, `task_retry`, `task_get`, `task_update_status`) now return `Result<_, KernelOpError>`. The kernel impl emits `NotFound { kind: "agent", id }` when the agent UUID-or-name lookup fails — the substring-grep that the historical `String` error required is gone. `crates/librefang-api/src/routes/task_queue.rs` introduces a small `map_kernel_op_err` helper that maps `NotFound`→404, `Invalid`→400, `Unavailable`→503, fallback→500, replacing the unconditional `ApiErrorResponse::internal` at all 8 call sites. (#3541 2/N) (@houko)
- **`MemoryAccess` role trait migrated to `KernelOpError`** (#3541 3/N): `memory_store`, `memory_recall`, `memory_list` flipped from `Result<_, String>` to `Result<_, KernelOpError>`. Test stubs and call sites in `librefang-runtime/src/tool_runner.rs`, `librefang-runtime-wasm/src/host_functions.rs`, and the kernel-handle test fixtures all moved over. Callers in tool_runner / host_functions bridge to their surrounding `Result<_, String>` shells with `.map_err(|e| e.to_string())?` until those wrappers themselves migrate. 3 of 14 role traits typed; `Other(String)` catch-all population keeps shrinking. (#3541 3/N) (@houko)
- **`HandsControl` / `WorkflowRunner` / `GoalControl` migrated to `KernelOpError`** (#3541 4/N): bundles three small role traits — 8 methods total (`hand_list`, `hand_install`, `hand_activate`, `hand_status`, `hand_deactivate`, `run_workflow`, `goal_list_active`, `goal_update`). Default impls now return `KernelOpError::Unavailable { capability: "Hands system" / "Workflow engine" / "Goal system" }` instead of opaque "X not available" strings — callers can branch on the variant directly. `LibreFangKernel::hand_deactivate` emits `Invalid { field: "instance_id" }` for malformed UUIDs; `goal_update` emits `NotFound { kind: "goal", id }` when the goal isn't in the store. 6 of 14 role traits typed. (#3541 4/N) (@houko)
- **`ChannelSender` / `ApprovalGate` / `PromptStore` / `AgentControl` migrated to `KernelOpError`** (#3541 5/N — final): closes the migration. `ChannelSender` (7 methods) covers the channel send + roster surface; `ApprovalGate` (4 methods) covers the approval lifecycle; `PromptStore` (13 methods) covers prompt versions + experiments; `AgentControl` (6 methods — `spawn_agent`, `spawn_agent_checked`, `send_to_agent`, `send_to_agent_as`, `kill_agent`, `run_forked_agent_oneshot`) covers agent lifecycle on the hot path. Default impls return `KernelOpError::Unavailable { capability: "Channel … send" / "Approval system" / "Prompt store" / "run_forked_agent_oneshot" }` so callers branch on the variant. All 12 fallible role traits now use the typed enum (the remaining `A2ARegistry` returns `Option<…>` and `ToolPolicy` has no fallible methods). Substring-grepping at the runtime↔kernel boundary is gone. (#3541 5/N) (@houko)
- `librefang-api` no longer declares `librefang-runtime` as a direct dependency; the API → Kernel → Runtime layering is now compiler-enforced. `cargo check` rejects any new `use librefang_runtime::*` in the api crate. PR 1/N (#4590) seeded the kernel re-exports and migrated 15/34 import sites; this 2/N completes the migration: 16 kernel re-exports total (`a2a`, `agent_loop`, `audit`, `browser`, `catalog_sync`, `channel_registry`, `compactor`, `copilot_oauth`, `drivers`, `http_client`, `kernel_handle`, `llm_driver`, `llm_errors`, `mcp`, `mcp_oauth`, `mcp_server`, `media`, `model_catalog`, `pdf_text`, `plugin_manager`, `plugin_runtime`, `provider_health`, `registry_sync`, `silent_response`, `str_utils`, `tool_runner`); every src + tests file under `crates/librefang-api/` flipped to the `librefang_kernel::*` path; `librefang-runtime` line removed from `crates/librefang-api/Cargo.toml`. `scripts/check-api-runtime-decoupling.sh` flipped from informational to enforcing — fails CI if the dep or any direct import comes back. (#3596 2/N) (@houko)
- **`KernelOpError` is now an alias for `LibreFangError`** (#3541 8/N — final): closes the gap between the kernel-handle trait surface and the workspace's canonical structured-error enum (`librefang_types::error::LibreFangError`). The 5 categorical variants from 1/N–7/N collapse onto richer business variants: `Unavailable { capability }` → new `LibreFangError::Unavailable(String)`; `NotFound { kind: "agent", id }` → `AgentNotFound(_)`; `NotFound { kind: "session", id }` → `SessionNotFound(_)`; `Invalid { field, reason }` → `InvalidInput(_)`; `Serialize(_)` → `Serialization { source, message }`; `Other(_)` → `Internal(_)`. The new `KernelResult<T> = Result<T, KernelOpError>` alias makes new role-trait method signatures self-documenting. `LibreFangError` is `#[non_exhaustive]` (already was), so adding new variants in the future doesn't break callers. The api `map_kernel_op_err` helper in `routes/task_queue.rs` and the `routes/workflows.rs` matcher both pick up extra business categories for free (`AuthDenied`/`CapabilityDenied` → 403, `ManifestParse`/`InvalidState` → 400, `ShuttingDown`/`Unavailable` → 503). #3541 fully closed; the substring-grep anti-pattern at the runtime↔kernel seam is gone. (#3541 8/N) (@houko)
- `librefang-api` → `librefang_kernel` internal import surface reduced from 47 to 11 `use` statements (branch) and further to 15 script-counted refs (7 of which are intentional `pub use` facade re-exports in `approval`, `error`, `mcp_oauth`, `middleware`, `trajectory`, `triggers`, `workflow`). Inline qualified paths in `channel_bridge.rs`, `config.rs`, `server.rs`, and `pairing.rs` consolidated into `use` imports at the top of each file; `librefang_kernel::auth::UserRole` in `pairing.rs` now routes through `crate::middleware::UserRole`. Remaining hard boundary: `LibreFangKernel` concrete type in `AppState`, `server.rs`, `channel_bridge.rs`, and `routes/agents.rs::inject_attachments_into_session` — these require invasive `KernelHandle` widening deferred to a follow-up. Refs #3744. (@houko)

- **`AppState.bridge_manager` migrated from `tokio::sync::Mutex<Option<BridgeManager>>` to `arc_swap::ArcSwap<Option<BridgeManager>>`** (#3747). Hot-reload reads are now lock-free atomic loads; the stop/swap path uses `ArcSwap::swap` + `Arc::try_unwrap` to obtain owned access for `BridgeManager::stop()`. `arc-swap` is already a workspace dependency (used by `librefang-kernel`); the `librefang-api` and `librefang-testing` crates now declare it explicitly. The `prometheus_handle` field was already absent from `AppState` (parked in a module-level `OnceLock` in `crate::telemetry`); the `peer_registry` field was also already absent (all routes call `state.kernel.peer_registry_ref()` directly). No behaviour change. (@houko)
- **macOS now skips the Keychain by default for the vault master key.** macOS Keychain ACLs are bound to the per-binary code signature, so every fresh `cargo build` invalidates the ACL and triggered an "allow" prompt on every daemon restart. The vault now uses the AES-256-GCM-wrapped file fallback at `~/Library/Application Support/librefang/.keyring` (mode 0600) by default on macOS — equivalent at-rest security in our threat model. Linux and Windows behaviour is unchanged. Override with `[vault] use_os_keyring = true` in `config.toml`, or force-disable on any platform with `LIBREFANG_VAULT_NO_KEYRING=1`. **Existing macOS users**: the daemon does one final Keychain read on first restart after upgrade, mirrors the master key into the file store, and never touches the Keychain again. To clean up the now-unused entry, run `security delete-generic-password -s librefang-vault -a master-key`. # pragma: no-attribution
- Default `api_listen` flipped from `0.0.0.0:4545` to `127.0.0.1:4545` (loopback-only). New installs are local-only by default; set `api_listen = "0.0.0.0:4545"` to expose on LAN/remote. Affects `librefang init`, the dashboard's init endpoint, and `librefang.toml.example`. `librefang start` with an explicit `--config <path>` that doesn't exist now prints a clear `librefang init` hint instead of failing obscurely. (#2766) # pragma: no-attribution
- **iOS minimum supported version raised from 14.0 to 16.0.** Required by the Tauri 2 mobile toolchain that the new mobile CI builds against. Devices on iOS 14 or 15 (iPhone 6s, original iPhone SE, iPad Air 2 and similar) will no longer be able to install the LibreFang mobile app once mobile bundles ship. Affects only the iOS app — the desktop and Android builds are unchanged. (#3970) # pragma: no-attribution

### Security

- **`jsonwebtoken` crypto-provider feature now explicitly enabled (#5128).** While landing the OIDC `sub`-required tests below, the new integration suite uncovered a pre-existing latent bug: the workspace was pulling `jsonwebtoken = "10"` with default features, which enables `pem` parsing but installs no `CryptoProvider`. `jsonwebtoken` 10.x panics at `decode::<_>` time when neither `rust_crypto` nor `aws_lc_rs` is enabled — so any real OIDC token validation on the daemon (`/api/auth/introspect`, the OAuth callback's ID-token path, and the `oidc_auth_middleware`) would have panicked the first time it processed a signed JWT. The workspace `jsonwebtoken` dep now opts in to `aws_lc_rs` to match the rustls provider that `librefang-cli` installs at startup. (@houko)

- **OIDC `sub` claim is now strictly required on the external-auth path (#5128).** Three defects collided into a session-mixing vulnerability: (1) `IdTokenClaims.sub` carried `#[serde(default)]`, so a JWT missing the `sub` claim deserialised cleanly with `sub = ""`; (2) `validate_jwt_cached` only enforced `aud` + `exp`, never `sub`; (3) the OAuth callback then called `TOKEN_STORE.store(&claims.sub, …)` keyed on the empty string, so every token-less login collided on the same slot and a fresh sign-in could silently inherit the previously-stored user's refresh token. Fix lands the defence in three independent gates so the regression cannot recur: the `#[serde(default)]` attribute is gone (a missing claim now fails deserialisation), `validation.set_required_spec_claims(&["sub","exp","aud"])` is configured before `decode::<IdTokenClaims>` (catches the missing-claim case at the JWT layer even for callers that bypass the struct shape), and `validate_jwt_cached` rejects `claims.sub.is_empty()` after decoding (catches the explicit `"sub": ""` case which is structurally valid at the first two layers). The OAuth callback adds a final `claims.sub.is_empty()` guard before `TOKEN_STORE.store`, protecting the userinfo-fallback branch (where `sub` comes from `info["sub"].or(info["id"]).unwrap_or("")` and could otherwise still land empty). The same `validate_jwt_cached` change protects `/api/auth/userinfo`, `/api/auth/introspect`, and the `oidc_auth_middleware` — every call site funnels through the one function. Tests: 3 new `#[tokio::test]` cases in `crates/librefang-api/tests/oauth_sub_required_test.rs` that generate an RSA-2048 keypair in-process, serve the JWKS from a local axum listener on `127.0.0.1:0`, and drive `/api/auth/introspect` with JWTs that exercise each gate: `introspect_rejects_jwt_with_missing_sub_claim`, `introspect_rejects_jwt_with_empty_sub_claim`, and `introspect_accepts_jwt_with_well_formed_sub_claim` as the no-regression control. (@houko)

- **CI + runtime supply-chain audit for marketplace skills/hands/templates** — `.pth` import-hijack files, `base64`+`exec`/`eval` payloads, jailbreak/exfil prompt phrases, and `sys.path`/`importlib` abuse are now caught at two layers: (1) the `supply-chain-audit` CI workflow (`.github/workflows/supply-chain-audit.yml`) gates every PR touching skill/hand/extension trees; (2) `librefang_skills::supply_chain::scan()` runs at marketplace install time and refuses the install (`SkillError::SecurityBlocked`) if any critical finding is detected, cleaning up the partially-extracted directory. Set `LIBREFANG_SKIP_SUPPLY_CHAIN_AUDIT=1` to bypass for dev/testing (emits a WARN). Closes #3333. (@houko)

- **Channel webhook HMAC verification is now mandatory** for Messenger, LINE, Teams, Viber, and DingTalk. Previously, missing signature headers were silently bypassed; they now return `400 Bad Request`, and signature mismatches return `401 Unauthorized`. **Action required if you operate any of these channels:** # pragma: no-attribution
  - **Messenger** — set `MESSENGER_APP_SECRET` to your Facebook App Secret (the new `app_secret_env` field in `[channels.messenger]` defaults to this). If unset, signatures are skipped with a startup warning and the endpoint stays unauthenticated — production should always set it. # pragma: no-attribution
  - **Teams** — set `TEAMS_SECURITY_TOKEN` to the base64 outgoing-webhook security token from the Teams portal (the new `security_token_env` field in `[channels.teams]`). Same fallback semantics as Messenger. # pragma: no-attribution
  - **LINE / Viber / DingTalk** — no new env vars, but probes that don't carry the platform's signature header (curl, monitoring health checks pointed at the webhook path) will now return 4xx instead of 200. # pragma: no-attribution
- **Outbound `[channels.webhook] callback_url` is SSRF-guarded.** Adapters refuse to start if the URL resolves to a private (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), CGN (`100.64/10`), loopback (`127/8`, `::1`), link-local, multicast, or cloud-metadata range. Catches IPv6 short forms like `[::]`, IPv4-mapped (`[::ffff:127.0.0.1]`), NAT64, and trailing-dot FQDNs. **Action required**: local dev setups using `callback_url = "http://127.0.0.1/..."` must switch to a public tunnel (ngrok, cloudflared) or omit `callback_url`. (#3942) # pragma: no-attribution
- **BREAKING**: `require_auth_for_reads` now defaults to *enabled* whenever any form of authentication is configured (`api_key`, `user_api_keys`, or dashboard credentials). Previously the flag had to be set explicitly, leaving read endpoints open even on instances with an `api_key`. Operators who deliberately want open reads on an authenticated instance (e.g. behind a trusted reverse proxy) must now set `require_auth_for_reads = false` in `config.toml`. A boot-time INFO log records when the flag is auto-enabled. (#2448) # pragma: no-attribution

### Quality

- CI Test job split into **Unit** (`lib+bin`, ~2 min, single Ubuntu runner) and **Integration** (`--tests`, sharded across 4 Ubuntu shards + macOS + Windows). Unit failures now surface in ~2 min without waiting for the full integration matrix. Local fast iteration: `cargo nextest run --workspace --lib --bins`. Full validation: `cargo nextest run --workspace --no-fail-fast`. Closes #3696. (@houko)

### Maintenance

- Wire `cargo xtask integration-test` into CI as a `live-integration-smoke` job — spawns a real `target/debug/librefang start` daemon on every PR touching Rust or CI files, hits `/api/health`, `/api/agents`, `/api/budget`, `/api/network/status`, and SIGTERMs. Catches the failure modes the in-process integration tests miss (route not registered in `server.rs`, daemon failing to bind, config fields not deserializing). Runs with `--skip-llm` to keep the gate hermetic; the live-LLM branch is reserved for the release/nightly workflow that has provider keys. (#3405) (@houko)
- **`LibreFangKernel` god-struct decomposed into 13 typed subsystem handles** (#3565 / #4756). Pre-fix the kernel held ~70 flat fields owning every subsystem the runtime touches; post-fix it holds 33 fields — 13 subsystem handles (`agents`, `events`, `memory`, `workflows`, `llm`, `security`, `skills`, `mcp`, `media`, `mesh`, `governance`, `metering`, `processes`) plus the residual cross-cutting state (boot dirs, config, wasm sandbox, context engine, log reloader, `shutdown_tx`, `prompt_metadata_cache`, `auto_reply_engine`). Inner field names are preserved verbatim so the migration across ~600 internal call-sites is a literal rename (`self.X` → `self.<sub>.X`); the three inner-name collisions are resolved as `metering.engine` (was `metering`), `workflow.engine` (was `workflows`), and `memory.substrate` (was `memory`). Each subsystem additionally exposes a focused `*SubsystemApi` trait (e.g. `MeteringSubsystemApi`, `ProcessSubsystemApi`) and `LibreFangKernel` forwards them all in `subsystem_forwards.rs`, so new callers and test mocks can bind `&dyn FooSubsystemApi` without dragging in the whole `KernelApi` surface — existing `Arc<dyn KernelApi>` flows are unchanged. Boundary tests next to `ProcessSubsystemApi` and `MeteringSubsystemApi` assert object-safety, `Send + Sync`, and routing through `&dyn`, including a `StubProcesses` mock proving the trait shape is implementable without `LibreFangKernel`; the remaining 11 traits will gain the same coverage as consumers materialise. Drop ordering is not load-bearing — `LibreFangKernel::shutdown` is broadcast-based via `shutdown_tx` and explicitly drains `agents.supervisor` → `workflows.engine` → memory in order, documented at the top of `kernel::subsystems`. Method-body migration into per-subsystem `impl` blocks and the carving of the monolithic `KernelApi` trait are left as the next refactor. (@houko)

### Documentation

- Per-crate `AGENTS.md` for the six core crates (`librefang-{kernel,runtime,types,llm-driver,extensions,channels}`). Telegraph-style: scope, module map, lock strategy, taboos, common gotchas. Each one ships with a sibling `CLAUDE.md` symlink so AI tooling that walks up looking for `CLAUDE.md` (older Claude Code builds, Codex CLI variants) finds the same rules. New CI gate `agents-claude-pair` verifies the symlink remains in place via `scripts/check-agents-claude-pair.sh`. The dashboard's existing `AGENTS.md` also gains the symlink. (#3297) (@houko)

## [2026.4.28] - 2026-04-28

_67 PRs from 4 contributors since v2026.4.27-beta6._

### Highlights

### Changed

- Derive JSON Schema from KernelConfig via schemars (#3055) (@houko)
- Extract SessionStore trait alongside SQLite substrate (#3089) (@houko)

- Merge duplicate type definitions across crates (#3185) (@houko)
- Rename Action enums to disambiguate from domain types (#3188) (@houko)
- **BREAKING**: Split coding-provider API keys onto dedicated env vars — `byteplus_coding` now reads `BYTEPLUS_CODING_API_KEY` (was `BYTEPLUS_API_KEY`), `volcengine_coding` reads `VOLCENGINE_CODING_API_KEY` (was `VOLCENGINE_API_KEY`), `zai_coding` reads `ZAI_CODING_API_KEY` (was `ZHIPU_API_KEY`), `zhipu_coding` reads `ZHIPU_CODING_API_KEY` (was `ZHIPU_API_KEY`). Per-token siblings (`byteplus`, `volcengine`, `zai`, `zhipu`) keep their original env vars. Set the new env var if you use any `_coding` provider. (#3279) (@houko)
- **BREAKING**: Register `microsoft` (GitHub Models / Azure AI Inference) as an explicit driver-registry entry with its own `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` env var, distinct from `github-copilot`'s `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Same PAT works for both, but the env vars are now separate so configuring one product no longer auto-activates the other in the model picker. Set `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` if you use the `microsoft` provider. (#3281) (@houko)
- **BREAKING**: Split `zai` from sharing `ZHIPU_API_KEY` with `zhipu` — `zai` (api.z.ai) now reads `ZAI_API_KEY` while `zhipu` (open.bigmodel.cn) keeps `ZHIPU_API_KEY`. Same Zhipu credential value works for both, but the env vars are now separate so configuring one no longer auto-activates the other. Set `ZAI_API_KEY` if you use the `zai` provider. (#3285) (@houko)

## [2026.4.18] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Forked agent pattern: kernel exposes `run_forked_agent_streaming(agent_id, prompt, allowed_tools)` for derivative LLM calls that share the parent turn's system + tools + message prefix (Anthropic prompt cache alignment) without persisting the derivative's messages into the canonical session. Anthropic driver's `cache_control` extended from system-only to cover both the last tool block (system + tools prefix) AND the last content block of the last message (full conversation prefix), giving forks near-full cache coverage. Dashboard settings page now surfaces cache-hit rate and per-dream cost so the forkedAgent savings are visible. Proactive-memory `LlmMemoryExtractor` migrated to the forkedAgent pattern: a new trait method `extract_memories_with_agent_id` routes the extraction LLM call through `KernelHandle::run_forked_agent_oneshot` (a new trait method that drives a single-turn fork and returns the final text), sharing the parent agent's `(system + tools + messages)` cache key. The extraction-specific system prompt is embedded into the fork's user message rather than replacing the agent's system prompt, so cache alignment holds. Fall back to a standalone `driver.complete()` with `prompt_caching = true` when no kernel handle is installed (tests / rule-based extractor / fork failure) so system-prompt caching still applies. Kernel wires the extractor's weak handle inside `set_self_handle` — first call only, matching the auto-dream hook idempotency pattern. Migrates auto-dream off its previous `SenderContext { channel: "auto_dream" }` side-channel pattern — dreams now fork from the canonical session and the kernel-side `channel == AUTO_DREAM_CHANNEL` tool filter is replaced by runtime `LoopOptions::allowed_tools` enforcement at tool execute time (request schema stays byte-identical to parent for cache alignment, model's `tool_use` for disallowed tools returns synthetic error). Agent loop adds `LoopOptions { is_fork, allowed_tools }` threaded through; fork turns skip `save_session_async` and add `"is_fork": true` to `AgentLoopEnd` hook context data so subscribers can filter fork events. Auto-dream's own hook filters fork turns to avoid dream-triggers-dream recursion. (@houko)
- Auto-dream: per-agent background memory consolidation with four-layer gating (global / per-agent opt-in / time / session count / file lock). Triggered event-driven from the `AgentLoopEnd` hook (fires the moment an agent finishes a turn) with a sparse daily backstop scheduler for opted-in agents that never turn. Includes web dashboard toggle card, TUI Dashboard strip, `[auto_dream]` config section, `DreamConsolidation` audit events with token and cost capture, runtime tool allowlist enforcement, and `GET/POST/PUT /api/auto-dream/status|trigger|abort|enabled` endpoints.
