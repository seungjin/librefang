# Repository Secrets

This document tracks every GitHub Actions secret the LibreFang workflows
consume, why each one exists, and how to rotate it. **Update this file
whenever a workflow starts or stops using a secret** — silent drift is
the failure mode that bites maintainers six months later when a release
breaks and nobody remembers what `FOO_TOKEN_2` was for.

> Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Secrets are organisation-wide unless noted. Forks do not inherit them by
design — the `pull_request` trigger explicitly runs without secrets, so
any workflow gated on a fork-PR build must degrade gracefully when the
secret is empty.

## Mobile distribution (release.yml `mobile_android` / `mobile_ios`)

Required to attach signed mobile artifacts to GitHub releases. When any
of these are absent the corresponding mobile job degrades to an unsigned
debug build and skips the release-attach step — desktop builds are
unaffected.

### Android

| Secret | Purpose | Format | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64` | Base64-encoded `release.jks` keystore. Lose this and Play Store will refuse all future updates — the package identity is bound to its signing key. **Back up offline.** | `base64 -w0 release.jks` | Forever (per Play Store policy) — only rotate if compromised, with explicit Play Store key-rotation flow |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Password for the `.jks` keystore | UTF-8 | When personnel changes |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Alias of the release key inside the keystore | plain string | n/a |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the alias (often same as keystore password but treated separately) | UTF-8 | When personnel changes |

**Generation reference**

```sh
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.jks -alias librefang \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
base64 -w0 release.jks > keystore.b64   # paste contents into ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64
```

### iOS / Apple

| Secret | Purpose | Format | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | 10-char Apple developer team ID | plain string (e.g. `ABCDE12345`) | n/a |
| `APPLE_CERT_P12` | Distribution certificate (`.p12`) | `base64 -w0 dist.p12` | **Yearly** — Apple distribution certs expire after one year |
| `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password set when exporting the `.p12` from Keychain Access | UTF-8 | When personnel changes |
| `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_B64` | Distribution provisioning profile (`.mobileprovision`) | `base64 -w0 librefang.mobileprovision` | **Yearly** — bound to the cert above |

**Rotation runbook (yearly Apple cert refresh)**

1. Apple Developer portal → Certificates → renew the iOS Distribution cert.
2. Download `.cer`, double-click to import into Keychain Access.
3. Right-click the new cert → Export → save as `.p12` with a strong password.
4. Update `APPLE_CERT_P12` and `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD` in repo secrets.
5. Profiles tab → regenerate the matching distribution provisioning
   profile against the new cert.
6. Update `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_B64`.
7. Trigger `release.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` against a tagged commit
   to validate end-to-end before the next real release.

## Mobile store distribution (release.yml `mobile_android` / `mobile_ios`)

Required to push signed builds straight to **Play Internal Testing** and
**TestFlight** without a human in the loop. Independent of the signing
secrets above — when these are absent the build still attaches to the
GitHub release; only the store-promotion step is skipped.

### Google Play

| Secret | Purpose | Format | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Service-account JSON for the Google Play Developer API. Must hold the **Release Manager** role (or narrower: "Release to testing tracks") on `ai.librefang.app` | Raw JSON (paste contents directly) | When personnel changes or the SA key is rotated in GCP |

**Generation reference**

1. Play Console → Setup → API access → link a Google Cloud project.
2. In GCP, create a service account, generate a JSON key, download it.
3. Back in Play Console → API access → grant the SA the *Release Manager*
   role (or the narrower "Release to testing tracks" if you want the
   automation locked out of production).
4. Paste the JSON contents into `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`. No
   base64 step required — the secret store handles multi-line values.

### Apple TestFlight (App Store Connect API)

| Secret | Purpose | Format | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API key identifier (10-char string) | plain string | When the key is revoked |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ISSUER_ID` | Issuer ID of the Apple developer team (UUID) | plain string | n/a |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_P8` | PKCS8-formatted private key contents (`-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- … -----END PRIVATE KEY-----`) | raw `.p8` text incl. BEGIN/END | Rotate yearly or on personnel change |

**Generation reference**

1. App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store
   Connect API → Generate a key with **App Manager** role.
2. Download the `.p8` (one-time download — keep an offline backup).
3. Copy the issuer ID from the same page.
4. Paste the raw `.p8` contents (including the BEGIN / END lines) into
   `APPLE_API_KEY_P8`. GitHub Actions accepts multi-line secret values;
   no base64 step is required.

API-key auth is preferred over Apple-ID + app-specific password: the key
is revocable per-key without 2FA prompts and does not inherit the human
owner's account scope.

---

## Desktop signing (release.yml `desktop`)

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MAC_CERT_BASE64` | macOS Developer ID Application cert (.p12, base64) for signing the Tauri desktop bundles |
| `MAC_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password for the .p12 above |
| `MAC_NOTARIZE_APPLE_ID` | Apple ID used for `notarytool submit` |
| `MAC_NOTARIZE_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for that Apple ID |
| `MAC_NOTARIZE_TEAM_ID` | Apple team ID for notarisation |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Tauri updater signing key (PEM) — DO NOT confuse with the Apple Developer cert; this signs auto-update manifests |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Passphrase for the updater key |

---

## Package registries

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NPM_TOKEN` | Publishes `@librefang/*` packages to npm |
| `PYPI_API_TOKEN` | Legacy fallback only — primary path is OIDC trusted-publishing |
| `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | Publishes `librefang-sdk` (and friends) to crates.io |

PyPI uses GitHub OIDC trusted publishing where possible — keep the API
token only as a break-glass option.

---

## Arch pacman repository (release.yml `publish_arch_repo`)

Build, GPG-sign, and publish the project-maintained pacman repository to Cloudflare R2 (`packages.librefang.ai`) on every tag.
This is the official binary repo installable with `pacman -Syu`, distinct from the AUR packages under `packaging/aur/`.
When the GPG key or any R2 credential is absent the job no-ops with a notice — nothing downstream depends on it, so forks and unconfigured repos are unaffected.

pacman verifies packages with **GPG/PGP only** — it cannot consume the cosign keyless signatures the rest of the release uses, so this is the project's first long-lived signing key.
Treat it accordingly: keep the **primary key offline**, register only a **passphrase-less signing subkey** in CI, and revoke the subkey (not the identity) if a runner is compromised.

| Secret | Purpose | Format | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ARCH_REPO_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` | Ascii-armored, passphrase-less signing **subkey**. `makepkg --sign` and `repo-add --sign` produce the `.sig` files and sign the db with it. Its public half is what users import via `pacman-key`. | `gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys <subkey-id>!` (incl. BEGIN/END) | Rotate the subkey on personnel change or runner compromise; the offline primary key and its fingerprint stay stable so users never re-import |
| `ARCH_REPO_GPG_KEY_ID` | The signing subkey id (or its fingerprint) passed to `makepkg --sign --key` / `repo-add -k`. | hex key id / fingerprint | Matches the subkey above |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | R2 S3 access key id for the bucket behind `packages.librefang.ai`. Scope it to that one bucket. | plain string | When personnel changes or the key is compromised |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | R2 S3 secret access key paired with the id above. | plain string | With the id above |

`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is reused from the Workers deploys (it forms the R2 S3 endpoint host); no new account secret is needed.
The bucket name defaults to `librefang-packages` (the `r2-bucket` action input) — override it there if your bucket differs.

**Generation reference**

```sh
# 1. Create the signing key once, OFFLINE. Use a primary key for identity and
#    a separate signing subkey for CI so the subkey can be revoked alone:
gpg --quick-generate-key "LibreFang Packaging <packaging@librefang.ai>" ed25519 sign never
gpg --quick-add-key <PRIMARY_FPR> ed25519 sign 2y          # the CI subkey

# 2. Export ONLY the subkey's secret half (note the trailing '!'), no passphrase:
gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys <SUBKEY_ID>! > arch_repo_signing.asc   # → ARCH_REPO_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY
echo <SUBKEY_ID>                                                            # → ARCH_REPO_GPG_KEY_ID

# 3. Create an R2 bucket + S3 access key in the Cloudflare dashboard,
#    bind it to packages.librefang.ai, paste the two values into the R2_* secrets.

# 4. Back up the OFFLINE primary key + its revocation certificate somewhere
#    the CI runner can never reach. Losing it means users must re-import a new key.
```

The public key is published to `https://packages.librefang.ai/<repo>.gpg` by the job itself on each run; the install docs (`packaging/arch-repo/README.md`) point users there.
Validate end-to-end with `workflow_dispatch` on `release.yml` (`channel=current`, `tag=<existing release>`) before the next real release.

---

## Internal infrastructure

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` | PAT with `contents:write` on `librefang/homebrew-tap` for `sync_homebrew` / `sync_homebrew_cask` |
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` / `RENDER_API_KEY` / `FLY_API_TOKEN` | One-click deploy preview environments triggered by `release.yml` |

---

## AUR publishing (release.yml `sync_aur_bin` / `sync_aur_desktop` / `sync_aur_docker`)

Push the release-pinned packages under `packaging/aur/` to the Arch User Repository on every tag.
When `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` is absent the three jobs no-op with a notice — nothing downstream depends on them, so forks and unconfigured repos are unaffected.

| Secret | Purpose | Format | Rotation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | SSH private key whose public half is registered on the AUR account that owns `librefang-bin`, `librefang-desktop-bin`, `librefang-docker`. Authenticates `git push ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/…`. | OpenSSH private key incl. BEGIN/END lines (multi-line; no base64) | When personnel changes or the key is compromised |
| `AUR_KNOWN_HOSTS` | Optional. `known_hosts` line(s) pinning `aur.archlinux.org`. When absent the workflow fetches them with `ssh-keyscan` at runtime (trust-on-first-use). Set it to remove the TOFU window. | `ssh-keyscan aur.archlinux.org` output | When AUR rotates its host key |
| `AUR_GIT_NAME` | Optional. Commit author name for AUR pushes. Defaults to `LibreFang Release Bot`. | plain string | n/a |
| `AUR_GIT_EMAIL` | Optional. Commit author email for AUR pushes. Defaults to `release-bot@librefang.ai`. | email | n/a |

**Generation reference**

```sh
# 1. Dedicated keypair for CI (no passphrase — Actions cannot answer a prompt):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "librefang-aur-ci" -f aur_ci -N ""

# 2. Register the PUBLIC key on the AUR account that owns the packages:
#    https://aur.archlinux.org/account → "SSH Public Key" (append aur_ci.pub).

# 3. Paste the PRIVATE key (aur_ci, incl. BEGIN/END) into AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY.

# 4. (Optional) pin the host key instead of relying on ssh-keyscan:
ssh-keyscan aur.archlinux.org   # paste into AUR_KNOWN_HOSTS
```

The AUR repositories (`ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/librefang-bin.git`, etc.) must exist and be owned by that account before the first push.
See `packaging/aur/README.md` for the one-time bootstrap.

## Operational rules

- **Never echo a secret.** GitHub Actions masks known secret values, but
  one `set -x` upstream of a `cat keystore.jks` will leak the binary —
  always pipe through `base64 --decode > "$RUNNER_TEMP/..."` directly.
- **Wipe runner copies.** Every workflow that materialises a secret to
  disk (`$RUNNER_TEMP/cert.p12`, `$RUNNER_TEMP/release.jks`, etc.) must
  end with an `if: always()` cleanup step so a build cancellation does
  not leave the artifact on a self-hosted runner.
- **Forks shouldn't fail.** All mobile and desktop signing steps are
  guarded by an "is this secret present?" check that downgrades to an
  unsigned build instead of failing the job. This keeps the smoke build
  meaningful for external contributors.
- **Rotate on personnel change.** When a maintainer with secret access
  leaves, rotate `*_PASSWORD` and any PAT-backed secrets within a week.

When in doubt, prefer adding a new secret over reusing an existing one
with overloaded scope — clarity at rotation time is worth the small
extra cost in the secret store.
